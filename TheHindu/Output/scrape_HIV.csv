,BELLARY: The new scheme launched by the Bellary District Aids Prevention Society (BDAPS), in association with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to help HIV-affected people and their families, has started yielding results.,Dakshayini and her husband have been living with HIV for the past eight years, and have been under Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). She is a field worker with Nityajeevana, an organisation of people with HIV/AIDS, and her husband a worker in the Bellary, Koppal and Raichur Milk Producers’ Union here. The couple have two children, both of whom do not have HIV. Today, she is all smiles as she is able to earn and supplement the family’s income owing to the loan scheme extended by the BDAPS.,“I availed myself of Rs. 15,000 as loan under the scheme with which I have started a sari and dress material selling business at my house in Shastri Nagar, with the help of my aunt. People, especially women in the neighbourhood, come regularly to purchase saris and dress materials from me on instalment basis. On an average, I earn around Rs. 5,000 a month,” Ms. Dakshayini told The Hindu. In addition, she continues her field visits to collect details of people living with HIV and verify whether the beneficiaries of the loan scheme have been repaying their instalments promptly.,Another notable feature has been that the stigma attached to the disease seems to be on the wane, if the way the women freely walking into the house of Ms. Dakshayini to buy saris is any indication.,Lokesh, a tailor who is also HIV-affected, has purchased a sewing machine attached with a motor, and has been stitching garments as well as undertaking sub-contracts in the field. “With one sewing machine I purchased earlier, I was working on a temporary basis. After getting the second one, my wife has also been working with me. In addition, I undertake sub-contracts to stitch garments. The loan scheme has really helped me,” he says.,The two are among 124 beneficiaries of the scheme spread all over the district. In all, 274 HIV-affected people have applied for loans. Perhaps for the first time in the country, an organisation such as the BDAPS, which has been set up with the Deputy Commissioner as the ipso facto Chairman, to monitor the implementation of the Coordinated HIV/AIDS Response through Capacity Building (CHARCA) Project, sponsored by the UNDP, thought of economic empowerment of HIV-affected people and their families, by arranging for bank loans so that they could take up various employment avenues.,Bellary is the only district in the State, and among six in the country where the CHARCA programme was implemented due to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS. Under the programme, various activities relating to knowledge dissemination, education and communication were undertaken to improve the lifestyle of those affected.,Owing to the initiatives by then Deputy Commissioner Arvind Srivastav, the UNDP agreed to sanction a sum of Rs. 30 lakh for the scheme. Bankers were also persuaded to come forward to give a matching grant in the form of loans. The attitude of the bankers, who were initially apprehensive over lending to HIV-affected people on the ground that their life span was short, indirectly affected the launch of the scheme. Detailed discussions with them helped bring about a change in approach, after which the Pragathi Grameen Bank, the State Bank of Mysore and Syndicate Bank, agreed to extend loans (Rs. 30,000 for dairy activities, Rs. 24,000 for sheep rearing and Rs. 15,000 for business, mostly supporting existing skills) with a 50 per cent subsidy to be given by BDAPS.,“Twenty more applications from people living with HIV are ready for clearance and a subsidy amount of Rs. 1.86 lakh has been released. Soon, the loan amount will be disbursed,” Dr. Jayakumar, District Health Officer, told The Hindu."

Each club has ten children from the Red Ribbon Clubs that have been promoted in the schools by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society – TANSACS.,The club members get adequate training in story developing and story telling techniques as also life skills by competent resource persons.,Around 45 trainings programmes have been conducted for them. During the training, adequate care was taken to make communication participatory and lively.,The story telling clubs have come out with 504 short stories on stigma /discrimination, some of them compete in quality and content that is deficient, by and large, among the debutants.,The NGO (Vasantham Trust) was now in the process of editing and developing them into a structured syllabus to be taught in the weekly once Red Ribbon classes. It was presumed that one STC member should conduct story telling session to ten to fifteen members in the school. Moreover, the children were effective communicators at community and family level. The STC members were expected to sensitise about 18,500 school children and their family members indirectly on reducing stigma/ discrimination through this innovative child friendly approach.,This was the first and bold attempt that the children prepare their own syllabus for addressing stigma, said the Headmaster of Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School, Marthandam, Lawrence.,This was an innovative idea recognised first by the World Bank when Vasantham Trust participated in the open competition for NGOs of nine South Asian countries on ‘Tackling HIV/AIDS’, said the Chief Educational Officer, Ponniha."

| Photo Credit: , ,A new strain of the virus that causes AIDS has been discovered in a woman from the African nation of Cameroon.,It differs from the three known strains of human immunodeficiency virus and appears to be closely related to a form of simian virus recently discovered in wild gorillas, researchers report in Monday’s edition of the journal Nature Medicine.,The finding “highlights the continuing need to watch closely for the emergence for new HIV variants, particularly in western central Africa,” said the researchers, led by Jean-Christophe Plantier of the University of Rouen, France.,The three previously known HIV strains are related to the simian virus that occurs in chimpanzees.,
,
,The most likely explanation for the new find is gorilla-to-human transmission, Plantier’s team said. But they added they cannot rule out the possibility that the new strain started in chimpanzees and moved into gorillas and then humans, or moved directly from chimpanzees to both gorillas and humans.,The 62-year-old patient tested positive for HIV in 2004, shortly after moving to Paris from Cameroon, according to the researchers. She had lived near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, but said she had no contact with apes or bush meat, a name often given to meat from wild animals in tropical countries.,The woman currently shows no signs of AIDS and remains untreated, though she still carries the virus, the researchers said.,How widespread this strain is remains to be determined. Researchers said it could be circulating unnoticed in Cameroon or elsewhere. The virus’ rapid replication indicates that it is adapted to human cells, the researchers reported.,

,A separate paper, also in Nature Medicine, reports that people with genital herpes remain at increased risk of HIV infection even after the herpes sores have healed and the skin appears normal.,The researchers found that long after the areas where the herpes sores existed seem to be clear, they still have immune-cell activity that can encourage HIV infection.,Herpes is marked by recurring outbreaks and has been associated with higher rates of infection with HIV. It had been thought that the breaks in the skin were the reason for higher HIV rates, but a study last year found that treatment of herpes with drugs did not reduce the HIV risk.,
,
,The researchers tested the skin of herpes patients for several weeks after their sores had healed and found that, compared with other genital skin, from twice to 37 times more immune cells remained at the locations where the sores had been.,“Understanding that even treated (herpes) infections provide a cellular environment conducive to HIV infection suggests new directions for HIV prevention research,” commented Dr. Anthony S.

The untold story of HIV positive children,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/The-untold-story-of-HIV-positive-children/article15575911.ece'],)","There is an urgent need to involve elected representatives, especially women at the gram panchayat and taluk panchayat levels to conduct awareness programmes on HIV/AIDS, according to Ravi Kittur, a social worker and councillor at the ART Centre in Bijapur district hospital.,Mr. Kittur attributes high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in a large number of people in Bijapur and Bagalkot districts to the ignorance of the people owing to high rate of illiteracy. He adds that once people come to know that they are HIV positive, they become introverts and refuse to talk about it in public. He underlines the need for initiating a discussion on the subject at the grassroots level so that its spread can be contained.,As per the Human Development Index report of Bijapur district, the number of HIV affected people in the district in 2005 was 2,887 of which 247 cases were from Basavan Bagewadi, 2,418 from Bijapur, 133 from Indi, 58 from Muddebihal and 30 from Sindagi taluk. Though Bagalkot district is a model in the country as far as Interventions for High Risk Groups are concerned, HIV prevalence among the general public is high. The early interventions in Bagalkot district in the form of India Canada Collaborative HIV AIDS project (ICHAP) and later by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) saw that the programmes for high risk groups saturated. The prevalence among sex workers has come down to six per cent in Mudhol and Jamakhandi taluks but the HIV prevalence among the bridge population is 41 percent and it is a little more than 50 per cent in the general population which is a cause for concern, according to experts.,Keeping this in view, the KSAPS had launched a door-to-door campaign in the month of August this year by involving actors and cricketers. Mr. Kittur says that he has taken the initiative to bring together sex workers in Bijapur district so that they can unitedly fight the spread of AIDS by way of becoming aware of safe sex practices and availing themselves of services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases."

Subburaj launched the helpline and made the first call on 1800-419-1800 posing a question from a real incident of discrimination to the counsellor. Speaking as a representative of a Chennai college, he said a couple of staff at the engineering college had been detected to be HIV positive. Students of the college were exercised by this and demanded that the cooks be dismissed from service.,The counsellor advised him not to sack the staff and instead to provide counselling to the college management and the students, assuring them that transmission of the virus through non-sexual routes was literally non existent.,Mr. Subburaj, speaking later, said the counsellor had provided satisfactory responses and he was sure that the helpline would be of benefit to PLHA and others with co-infections such as Tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.,Hello+ would address a long-felt need in the state’s HIV/AIDS control programme that had otherwise done very well in the areas of prevention and care and support, he said. It was absolutely crucial for positive people to be able to talk to others about their problems and seek help from professionals. Being able to voice their problems would bring down the burden substantially, Mr. Subburaj added. He suggested that some psychiatrists also be roped into the project.,
,
,Hello +, conceived and implemented as a public-private partnership between the USAID funded Aids Prevention and Control Project at VHS and Tata Business Support Services and Tata Teleservices, will also see the involvement of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society and networks of PLHA and NGOs.,Bimal Charles, project director, APAC, said while at present the helpline would be operational in Tamil Nadu, the Andhra Pradesh government had also expressed a willingness to join the programme. Eventually the facility would be available in all languages. Even today, people from all over the country can contact the number for information, but will receive information only in Tamil, Telugu, English and Hindi. He thanked the Tata group for providing free software and subsidising fifty per cent of the STD call charges.,S. Vijay Kumar, project director, TANSACS, said networks of positive people should encourage their members to register for anti-retro virals. A total of 50 link ART centres are coming up in the state in order to facilitate more PLHA to get treatment. Next year, 40 more such link centres would come up. He commended APAC and its partners for setting up a service that would be of help to all PLHA and those hesitating to test themselves for HIV.,Kerry Pelzman, Director, Public Health and Nutrition, USAID, released the information, education and communication material for using the helpline and handed over the first copy to a representative of positive networks.

Public telephone a blessing for those living with HIV/AIDS,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Public-telephone-a-blessing-for-those-living-with-HIVAIDS/article16335228.ece'],)","Living with pride: An HIV positive woman manning a coin telephone box at a PHC in Salem district.

The ringing sound and the clatter of voices near a phone have turned out to be the most suitable livelihood support for those living and suffering silently in the remote villages and hamlets in Salem district.,For those living with the infection, the monthly earning through the `One rupee’ Public Telephone Coin Box has not only kept their hearth burning but also enabled them to lead a quality life.,
,
,This transformation is made possible through a collaborative venture of the Department of Health, Private telecom firms and Project Concern International (PCI), an NGO working among the people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHAs) here.,The novel concept, first of its kind in the country, was launched in 2007 as a `pilot project’ without fanfare.,Twenty coin phone boxes were fixed at a few Primary Health Centres (PHC) in the district and in places where the public congregate. Recently five more have been added.,The project is based on `ownership’ concept wherein the beneficiary will have to pay Rs. 1500 as deposit to get a cost effective coin box. PCI’s S. Ramkumar says that Tata Telecom has offered them Rs. 500 as free talk time as initial incentive.,After assessing its success, Reliance has also come forward to enhance the profit margin and AirTel, another service provider, has expressed its wish to join them.,The project, according to a recent study, has thrown some healthy tales of survival. Says HIV affected Suresh (name changed), the only male beneficiary who runs a coin phone box at his village’s PHC, “The revenue through the Re.1 coin box ensures me a monthly income of Rs. 500 to Rs. 800.,It enables me to supplement my diet with nutritional inputs, which are quite essential for a quality life.” His claims are endorsed by other beneficiaries, all women, who eke out a livelihood from these coin phone boxes in many villages and in urban pockets. They say that though they are on free ART, the revenue from these coin boxes helps them meet the expenses they incur on the nutrition-rich food.,The study further says that 16 coin boxes, run by PLHAs, have erased the discrimination too. Among them are 19 women and of whom 14 are widows.Even after two years, 80 per cent of the boxes are ringing in a steady flow of money thus holding out a glimmer of hope to the victims.,`Salem Success’ has spurred the motivators to expand the project at national level."

Only if people are sensitised to the fact that it is a threat to humanity can social ostracism of people living with HIV-AIDS be tackled, according to A.

Sonalee, Managing Trustee, Transgender Community Action Network, and K.

Voluntary testing before marriage was as important as horoscope matching since, in numerous cases, women realised that they have been afflicted by the disease only during pregnancy.,Ms. Sonalee exhorted the society to consider transgenders as women. Neglect by own families is the prime cause for the social exclusion of transgenders, she said, observing that their predicament was precipitated by denial of jobs.,Explaining the chromosome factor as the determiner of physical and mental conditions of an individual, she said leading a pitiable life was not a matter of choice for transgenders. Ms. Sonalee lauded the Government’s initiatives to create a welfare board for transgenders and provide them with ration cards as right steps.,Mr. Jeyapal explained that the disease spread through unsafe sex, syringes and blood transfusion. There were methods to prevent mother-to-child transmission in the womb. Anti-retroviral drugs were available in all district headquarters hospitals, he said. RRC Programme Officer S. Vijayarani and Youth Red Cross Programme Officer Dhanalakshmi also took part in the panel discussion."

HIV cases on the rise,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/HIV-cases-on-the-rise/article15578581.ece'],)","Although new HIV infections show a downward trend in countries of the World Health Organisation's South-East Asia Region, particularly India, Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar, HIV/AIDS is still a serious public health problem. Perhaps the most vulnerable group are children with HIV/AIDS, whose number has increased by 46 per cent between 2001 and 2009. Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is possible by 2015 and WHO is committed to this goal.,On World AIDS Day, WHO calls on member-states to focus on strengthening health systems and ensuring early detection and treatment of HIV-affected persons.,Globally, an estimated 33.3 million people live with the virus, and 2.6 million were newly infected in 2009. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, 3.5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, largely in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand. In 2009, there were an estimated 2,20,000 new HIV infections in the region, and 2,30,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses.,
,
,The populations at highest risk of contracting HIV include female sex workers, homosexual men, transgender populations, and people who inject drugs. Issues of health care access, stigma and ignorance, and the imperative to prevent transmission of HIV to a new generation are central to the response to HIV/AIDS. Regionally, women constitute 37 per cent of the 3.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS, and without any intervention, about a third of infants born to HIV-positive mothers could acquire HIV.,
,
,Widespread implementation of WHO's new guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants could substantially reduce paediatric HIV and improve maternal and child survival.,In addition, greater sensitivity to the status of those living with HIV/AIDS, fighting prejudice and stigma and mainstreaming HIV/AIDS services are critical to overcoming the disease. WHO is advocating action to reduce stigma and discrimination in health care settings and communities, so that vulnerable and high-risk populations can access health care services without prejudice and fear. It is important for an individual to know of his or her HIV status and seek treatment accordingly."

Stigma and discrimination in society especially at the workplace, family, and health sector would be emphasised.,“Free legal service would be offered to all HIV positive people in the district on a continuous basis through this initiative,” Mr.Somesh added.,There had been a lot of positive changes in the medical sector in their attitude towards treating people living with HIV/AIDS owing to consistent advocacy programmes undertaken by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and other non-governmental organisations.,However, the public health centres (PHC) and the taluk hospitals did not undertake delivery of women with HIV/AIDS. Though TANSACS had appointed voluntary testing and counselling centres and laboratory technicians in all the 38 PHCs, the institutions still referred the delivery cases to the Government Hospital.,“For an HIV positive person in Valparai, it would take at least five hours to travel to Coimbatore, which is extremely difficult and unsafe for a pregnant woman.

The emphasis was on prevention through a region in the virus that is “quite constant” and useful for binding it to the cell. The team focused research on the covalent approach, rather than existing vaccines which are non-covalent in nature, to break the tolerance of the virus.,The method was adopted to see that the covalent vaccine, containing chemical extract, not only binds with the cell, but also ensures generation of more antibodies to prevent the spread of the virus. The approach was necessitated as the virus mutates rapidly and coupled with this was the immunity to the highly active retroviral therapies being used.,“Experiments have shown that we can break the tolerance and induce the cells to produce more antibodies that are broadly reactive to diverse strains so that the infection by all strains of the virus could be stopped,” he told The Hindu. The process involves development of abzymes (from antibody and enzyme) which are monoclonal antibodies with catalytic activity for permanently breaking thousands of virus molecules, unlike the regular antibody that can be targeted at a single molecule.,As the experiments were met with success, efforts were on to take the candidate for testing in human beings, preferably on the infected and those resistant to drugs. “Development of covalent vaccine is a completely new approach and the process of developing the vaccine should not take more than a year, provided we have enough money and community support.”,He admitted that there would be lot of resistance from scientists, but it was because science looks for proof."

,ANCHETTY (KRISHNAGIRI): A kattai panchayat in Sesurajapuram village in Krishnagiri district assumed “extra constitutional powers” and fined a woman recently. Her supposed sin: she is HIV infected.,Santhana Mary, whose husband, a victim of the dreaded disease, died one-and-a-half years ago, lives with her aged parents in the village with two daughters (fortunately not infected by the disease).,Mary ekes out a living by selling milk. Some youth, including a certain David, are alleged to have abused her on August 21. A distraught Mary told her parents about the incident and also her four brothers working as weavers in Erode.,When Mary’s mother Anthony Ammal went to David’s house to enquire about it she was said to have been beaten up and kicked by David and his father Arokyam. Her brothers – Ravi, Charles, Gnanaprakasam and Yesu – came to the village the same night. They went to David’s house to protest against the ill-treatment meted out to their mother and sister.,On August 22 some villagers went to Mary’s house and took her brothers, aged parents and a neighbour Periyasamy to the Anchetti police station alleging that they had damaged David’s house.,With the help of the police, village elders led by Marya Prakasam, a postman in Sesurajapuram village, reportedly conducted a kattai panchayat outside the police station and fined the family Rs. 30,000 for damaging David’s house. Mary’s brothers pleaded before the panchayat that they could pay only Rs. 15,000 and that they needed at least two weeks to pay the amount.,Mary, her brothers and parents were, however, detained by the police. A head constable on duty is alleged to have collected Rs. 2,000 from them to release them. A mediator (between the villagers and Mary’s family) Sandhiyahoo is said to have taken another Rs. 3,000 for food to the villagers who had come to the station.,Mary’s brothers came to the village from Erode on Sept. 12 with Rs. 15,000. Not content with this, Mr. Sandhiyahoo forcibly took a motor cycle belonging to Mr. Periyasamy, who had gone with the brothers, in lieu of the balance amount of Rs. 15,000. The vehicle was then handed over to the villagers who took the fine amount but refused to return the vehicle.,This was the last straw for Mary and her family. They petitioned the District Collector at the weekly grievances day meeting in Krishnagiri on Sept. 14.,The Collector, V.K.Shanmugham, directed the Superintendent of Police, A.G. Babu, to take appropriate action. Mr. Babu reprimanded the policeman who took Rs. 2000 and directed Sub-Inspector R. Manickam to retrieve the motor cycle and Rs. 15,000 from the villagers to return to Mary’s family.,Mr. Manickam got the vehicle back but is alleged to have asked Mary and her family members to give a written statement that David and her family had previous enmity. They, however, refused to give such a statement.,Mr. Manickam let the villagers off on Tuesday (Sept. 15) evening, but detained Mary and her family members, including the aged parents, till 11 p.m.,It was only at the intervention of Mr. Kumar, president, Krishnagiri District Living with HIV AIDS Welfare Society, that Mr. Manickam released them, after getting an assurance that they would come to the police station on Wednesday (Sept. 16) morning.,The vehicle is still with the police and Mary has not got back the Rs. 15,000 she had paid as fine. Mr. Manickam evaded a query as to whether any action had been initiated against the kattai panchayat but said he had registered first information reports against both the parties.,The police on Wednesday arrested Mary’s father Kannupaiyan and brothers Gnanaprakasam and Ravi and villagers Kuppu, Thammayan, Francis, Sesu alias Sesurajan and Arokyaraj. They were produced before the court in Denkanikottai which remanded them to judicial custody."

,
,NEW DELHI: Researchers associated with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) claim to have discovered two powerful, hitherto unknown antibodies to HIV. Researchers will now try to exploit the new found vulnerability of the virus to craft novel approaches in designing an AIDS vaccine, a paper published in the Science magazine said.,The global collaboration and process that led to the discovery of the two ‘broadly neutralising antibodies’ (bNAbs) are likely to produce more such antibodies, which may in turn reveal additional vulnerabilities of the HIV, adding still more vitality to the effort to develop a vaccine against AIDS.,Broadly neutralising antibodies to HIV are produced by a minority of HIV-infected individuals and are distinct from other antibodies to HIV in that they neutralise a high percentage of the many types of HIV in circulation worldwide.,According to the paper, it is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection an AIDS vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus. Before this finding, only four antibodies to HIV have been agreed to be ‘broadly neutralising.’,The two bNAbs, called PG9 and PG 16, are the first to have been identified in more than a decade and are the first to be isolated from donors in developing countries, where the majority of new HIV infection occur.,The paper — written by researchers at the IAVI, The Scripps Research Institute, Biosciences Monogram and Theraclone Sciences — says the breadth of neutralisation is important because any effective AIDS vaccine must provide protection from a diverse range of the most prevalent types of HIV circulating worldwide. High potency suggests that such antibodies will not have to be produced by the body in very large quantities to confer protection. The IAVI’s clinical research partners have collected blood specimens from more than 1,800 HIV-infected volunteers from the IAVI-supported clinical research centres in seven sub-Saharan countries as well as Thailand, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, the paper suggests."

It is a big mistake.” While the ICTCs carry out three tests on a mandatory basis, most of the times in private services, only one test was conducted which was also not “fool-proof.” He said the private nursing homes do not have trained lab technicians and counsellors for dealing with HIV cases.,
,
,Mr. Chandravadan announced that APSACS was launching a special campaign ‘Shubam’ to promote voluntary HIV testing among the most vulnerable groups like female sex workers, men having sex with men, migrants and truckers. The campaign will be taken up in a mission mode manner from July 12 to 30. It aims to improve referral to testing centres, convert all unknown HIV cases to known cases and streamline positive cases towards care, support and treatment services. Around one lakh people were expected to get tested during the special drive.,He said that of the total projected population of 8, 48, 43, 957 in the State, an estimated 50 per cent were sexually active adults. Among them, 25. 45 lakh (six per cent) were estimated to be prone to risky sexual behaviour. He said that it was estimated that the population of high risk groups was 1.64 lakh and only 10 per cent of them know their HIV status.,
,
,The Shubam campaign would also address the general population and would be conducted every year. He said HIV prevalence continued to be on the downward trend and the goal was to totally reverse and halt its spread by 2012.,Currently, there were 677 ICTCs in the State and another 250 would be started soon. Another 80 such centres would be started in Public-Private Partnership mode in private nursing homes."

,However, in October 2008, the Law Ministry returned a highly truncated version to the Health Ministry with important provisions deleted. In the following months, there were countrywide protests, resulting in the Law Ministry coming out with a revised draft in February.,The revised draft was also disappointing as it failed to address specific issues of relief during health care emergency for people living with HIV and AIDS, and of vulnerabilities of women and children to HIV, the protesters pointed out.,The important chapters of ‘Health Ombudsman’, ‘Special Provisions’ and ‘Special Procedures in Court’ continued to be truncated, they said.,Recently, the Law Ministry came out with its third draft, which is “not much different from the second draft with many of the important provisions still missing.”,“The Law Ministry has gone beyond its mandate and deleted substantive provisions. This is outside its domain. The work of the Law Ministry is only to check whether the provisions of the Bill are legally workable,” Anand Grover of the Lawyer’s Collective HIV/AIDS Unit said."

Sastry, Additional District Medical and Health Officer and AIDS and Leprosy Officer, Krishna district.,TB has been identified as the leading infectious killer of people living with HIV, while HIV activates dormant TB in a person, who then becomes infectious and spreads the TB bacillus to others.,“In the last four months, as many as 1,787 HIV positive people were tested for TB. Of them, 332 tested positive. Similarly, of the 1069 TB patients tested for HIV, 120 have been found positive for HIV. The patients have been referred to the TB centre and to the ICTC centre, respectively. As a final outcome, a total of 452 persons have been found to be affected by the co-infection,” says Dr. Sastry, pointing out that last year the number of co-infection cases detected in the district was much higher at 1,207.,The State-sponsored “Shubham” programme that preceded the special drive identified 3 per cent of the nearly 9,000 people screened for HIV among high-risk groups to be positive. “Krishna district stood first in the State by covering such a large number of people under the programme,” Dr. Sastry said. Female sex workers, MSMs, migrant workers were the target groups under “Shubham”. The district authorities conducted special camps at the work places of these high-risk groups . “Now that they know their positive status, they will avoid indulging in risk behaviour and that means curbing the spread of virus to a great extent,” says Dr. Sastry."

For a general public the testing would be similar to the blood test for malaria.,The project director of OSACS, Alekh Chandra Padhiary said the major advantage of the ‘whole blood finger-prick’ technology is that for it there would be no need to separate serum and red blood cells of a blood sample to test for HIV. This technology has been quite successful in Africal countries where most people are being tested for HIV by this new and fast technology. The conventional HIV testing kits being used now accept only serum collected from blood samples to test for HIV antibody. The presence of HIV antibody in one’s blood hints at HIV infection.,A centrifuge which separates the serum from the blood is a major need of conventional HIV testing technologies.,The new technology being tried now accepts whole blood and can tell HIV status by a simple finger prick.,A workshop was organised in Bhubaneswar on Thursday for the implementation of this HIV testing technology in Orissa. It was attended by a team from the NACO, officials of the OSACS, Chief District Medical Officers (CDMO) of Ganjam, Angul, Koraput, Bolangir, Balasore and Bhadrak districts.,These are HIV prone districts of Orissa.,The process of HIV testing through ‘whole blood finger-prick’ is expected to be first introduced in Ganjam district, the most AIDS prone district of Orissa.,

HIV entry ban repealed,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/HIV-entry-ban-repealed/article16485944.ece'],)","By announcing the end of a 22-year-old ban on the entry of people with HIV into the United States, President Barack Obama has once again shown that scientific considerations alone would shape decisions concerning science. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has followed up promptly, by publishing the rule in the Federal Register. The U.S. was one of a dozen countries that have archaic laws barring the entry of people infected by HIV. Although President George Bush amended the Immigration and Nationality Act last year, the HHS did not remove it from the list of communicable diseases. The ban in the U.S. was enacted in 1987 amidst widespread fears that HIV, like tuberculosis, was a communicable disease and spread through physical or respiratory contact. Accordingly, HIV infection was enlisted as a “communicable disease of public health significance” and the entry of visitors and immigrants with the infection banned. Despite the aetiology and routes of transmission of HIV becoming clearer over the last two decades, and UNAIDS and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) concluding, in 2004, that “HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions have no public health justification,” the irrational bar remained.,In fact, the illiberal law has not served the purpose of containing the spread of a virus that has become endemic in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the virus has infected about one million people. The entry ban has also ended up creating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and this in turn has kept people away from getting tested. According to the CDC, about one in five are not aware of their infection status and are responsible for 50-70 per cent of all new sexually transmitted infection cases. The fear of discrimination is one reason why the CDC 2006 recommendation that everyone between 13 years and 64 years should be routinely tested for the infection in medical encounters has not been heeded. An offshoot of the ban is that no international HIV/AIDS scientific conference has been held in the U.S. for the past 20 years. All this is likely to change. The U.S., which has played a pivotal role in fighting the war against the virus in Africa, can now set its house in order. Nearly half a dozen sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea have been wrongly classified as communicable diseases of public health significance. The CDC may remove them from its list in due course after a scientific review."
HIV risk perception among students has come down: Subburaj,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/HIV-risk-perception-among-students-has-come-down-Subburaj/article16483094.ece'],)","Special Correspondent,CHENNAI: While it was encouraging to note increasing levels of condom use across all high risk groups, it was a cause for concern that HIV risk perception among students had come down, Principal Secretary, Health, V.K.Subburaj, said.,Commenting on the results of the Behaviour Surveillance Survey (BSS) carried out by AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) Project in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, Mr. Subburaj said that it was unacceptable for risk perception to fall, especially among youngsters, both girls and boys. “Despite years of information communication, we have not managed to get through to some groups and discrimination and stigma still continue. So we have to modify our information and communication strategies years,” he added.,Clearly there is a need to step up activities of the Red Ribbon Clubs, started in educational institutions to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS, he suggested. However, if all agencies focussing on their allocated tasks properly, then it was possible to reach a stage of zero new infections, Mr.Subburaj said.,Earlier, he released a monograph on the results of the 12th wave of the BSS in Tamil Nadu and the seventh survey in Puducherry since 2001. The survey was conducted across 13 different population groups in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Theni, Salem, Vellore, Erode, Nagercoil, Dindigul, Palani, Tiruchirapalli and Tuticorin. In Pondicherry, the survey covered Puducherry and Karaikal districts. Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Tiruchi, Karur, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin were covered as Intensive Intervention Districts of APAC.,The population groups were female sex workers, truckers and helpers, male youth in slums, factory workers, migrant workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, transgenders, male patients at STD Clinics, Students and for the first time, People Living with HIV were included.,The key results indicated that there were both positives and negatives, Bimal Charles, director, APAC, said. Knowledge on at least two correct methods of preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV was close to 100 percent among all population groups except among female factory and migrant workers. Again, respondents almost universally reported that consistent condom usage prevents HIV, but more efforts are required to counter myths and misconceptions in intervention programs to spread awareness of STI and HIV.,As far as condom use goes, while it is high with paid partners, usage with non-paid or regular partners is comparatively lower. Needle sharing behaviour among IDUs has been showing a declining trend across all the waves and in the current wave, around 43.0 per cent reported such behaviour.,The incidence of STI is low in all categories and the treatment-seeking-behaviour from a qualified health practitioner continued to be very high, with a majority approaching a government STD clinic for the treatment.,There has been an increase in testing practices among all groups except migrant workers, factory workers and youth in slums. This is mainly due to the fact that risk perception among them is low, APAC officials pointed out.,S.Vijayakumar, project director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, said the key now is to use the lessons of the BSS to translate interventions into action.,Also indicating that a “zero-infection” rate was within the realm of achievement in the State, he urged all partners to ensure that healthcare is provided comprehensively and cost effectively to all those who need it.,E.S.Krishnamoorthy, honorary secretary, Voluntary Health Services, said the studying behaviour is important as it helps to plan for the future, prevent further infections, and stem the tide of the epidemic, at least in this instance. There are many lessons from the data of the BSS that could change the way policy is drawn up in future, he added."

Commissioning work was over. It would be put to use in a day or two, according to sources in the GH.,The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) has offered this equipment costing Rs.8 lakh to the GH. “It is a boon to HIV patients and physicians. It is a new and reliable test for the enumeration of CD4 cells in peripheral blood,” said doctors in the GH.,With the installation of this equipment, the ART Centre has wiped out its last resource-constraint. The CD4 lymphocytes (T-helper cells) were the major target cells of HIV infection. Progressive decline in CD4 levels, caused by various pathological processes associated with HIV infection, would increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections. The CD4 counts would serve as the major clinical indicators of immune competence in HIV patients. It would also help doctors in decision-making whether to initiate the therapy or not, doctors added.,If the CD counts level was less than 200, Anti-Retroviral treatment would be commenced immediately as this level indicated severe weakened immune system. If the level was more than 200, effective counselling would be given to patients to maintain nutrition levels.,The ART centre had been referring on an average 250 cases to Madurai for this test every month. From now, they could avail this facility in Dindigul GH itself.,The ART Centre also has HIV detection facilities, ART treatment, Legal Aid Cell for persons living with HIV and tests and treatment facilities for all venereal diseases under single roof.

Further, the national average of patients discontinuing from treatment was 10.2 per cent per year and it was just 2.5 per cent in the State. This was possible because of better treatment facilities made available to patients.,The level of awareness and the need to invest more in HIV/AIDS was due to the nature of the disease and associated problems of stigma and discrimination.

He appealed to doctors who had completed the fellowship programmes in the past four years to provide the best of care to the affected people.,G. Manoharan, medical director, I-TECH, said that along with GHTM, they had been conducting the fellowship programme since 2005 to prepare junior and fairly experienced doctors to be leaders in HIV/AIDS-related care and support, education and research in India and also to support the State government.,Till now, 49 people had completed this fellowship programme and 30 per cent of them were women.

Purandeswari has said.,Speaking at the launch of first health insurance of PLHIV here on Friday, she said if Guntur which had recorded a rate of 3.35 per cent in 2003 could reduce it to 1.75 per cent other districts also could do it. If people shy away from talking about AIDS, it’s difficult to contain it, she said. Besides the number of people using intravenous drugs was going up. Also to contain HIV, it’s necessary to have an open debate about gay rights, particularly in the light of Supreme Court judgment on Article 377.,On the government’s efforts to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS, she said in spite of the high cost the government was spending a lot of money on giving ART medicines. Population Services International’s Program Director (Project Connect) Atul Kapoor said the public-private partnership that brought together several agencies could serve to encourage other public/private insurance companies to examine insurance to PLHIV.,

The rise in the number of migrant labour and commercial sex workers in urban areas had led to more persons being infected. In Visakhapatnam it had gone up from .35 per cent in 2007 to .75 per cent in 2008. He also underlined the need to recognise gay sex (sexual minority groups) stating it was leading to incidence of more HIV.

Delay in tabling of the Bill had led to protests by activists.,Speaking about the book, originally written in the Malayalam, Mr. Moily said that more such books that speak openly and boldly against oppression of many kinds should be published in Kannada.

The book, he said, speaks “beyond the written word” and with courage, going beyond the binaries of moral-immoral and right and wrong.

Better news on the HIV front,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Better-news-on-the-HIV-front/article16050375.ece'],)","Although nearly 7,500 new cases of HIV infection are reported every day globally, the good news is that incidence rates are steadily declining in most parts of the world. HIV incidence has fallen by more than 17 per cent globally over the past nine years. But what is of greater significance is that it is happening in many African countries, the core of the epidemic and which for years had a disproportionately high number of new cases. According to the latest UNAIDS report, the incidence rate has dropped by more than 25 per cent in 22 sub-Saharan African countries, and many of them are well on the way to achieving the U.N. target of reducing HIV rates among the young this year. They include Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe — some of the countries with the largest HIV epidemics in the world. Better awareness of the risks and education on the different modes of transmission has been identified as the key factor that made it possible. A study published in the , in April this year attributes the decline in Zimbabwe to changes in sexual behaviour, particularly the use of condoms in non-regular partnerships. A dramatic reduction was also seen in the case of women in the 15-24 age group in South Africa. Despite the group reporting the highest incidence rate, the drop has been nearly 60 per cent between 2005 and 2008.,In a striking contrast to the picture emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, HIV incidence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is showing an upward trend. Russia has the largest AIDS epidemic in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Injection drug use is the main mode of transmission across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Similarly, once praised for drastically cutting down the prevalence rate from 30 per cent in the late 1980s to six per cent by late 1990s, HIV prevalence in Uganda is on the rise once again. Widespread use of anti-retroviral treatment and the resultant reduction in mortality has led to the increase. But the availability of drugs has also meant greater indulgence in risky behaviour. This, combined with the scaling down of prevention programmes due to complacency, has played a major role in pushing up the incidence rate. Uganda offers a good case study for India. The prevalence rate in India is low at approximately 0.36 per cent. The lesson in this for India is that there should be no let up in the drive to increase awareness and risk avoidance in the campaigns for AIDS prevention. There is absolutely no room for complacency on this vital front."

,Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1, people living with HIV, sexuality minorities and transgenders came together on a common platform on Monday to assert that peer tactics and strategies play a key role in HIV prevention.,At an interaction organised on Monday by the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), they alleged that professional counsellors appointed by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) in the Government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and Anti-Retroviral therapy (ART) centres were “indifferent” towards people who visited these centres for tests and treatment.,“They do not understand that we are already facing stigma and discrimination in society. Their approach towards the infected people is crude that discourages us from continuing treatment. We demand that KSAPS appoint peer counsellors in every centre so that we get counselled by people who know our problems,” Thyagaraj, General Secretary of Karnataka Network for People living with HIV, said.,Pointing out that provision of food and nutrition was essential for infected persons, Vijay Kumar from Sadhane, another group of the community, said most of the HIV deaths were owing to lack of nutrition. “Although we are getting free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, they are useless without proper nutrition. We try to mobilise foodgrains and other required items for the needy through our organisation at least for the first three months. But we want the Government to ensure that there is an assured regular supply,” he said.,The other problems faced by HIV positive people included lack of free healthcare facilities."

Chandramouli and GFATM executive director Michel Kazatchkine.,The programmes covered under the grant agreement include Integrated Counselling and Testing Services (ICTS), Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) services and HIV-TB collaborative services.,The overall goal of the grant is to reach and diagnose an estimated 65 per cent of the HIV-infected people in India and link them to care, support and treatment services. In order to achieve this, the NACO, through this grant, aims to counsel and test 1.82 crore clients annually in over 10,700 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) by the end of the project (2012).,

,An international trial, which has generated much excited anticipation, provides proof for the first time that pills used to treat HIV/AIDS can also prevent it. Campaigners greeted the results, published today in the ,, with enthusiasm, suggesting that they could fundamentally change the approach to preventing HIV in some groups of people.,The findings are good news for men who have sex with men, the population in whom the drugs were tried. There were 43.8 per cent fewer HIV infections among those who took Truvada, the once-a-day tablet containing two drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir, than among those who did not.,The protective effect was much greater in those who took the tablets consistently: The study was carried out by the independent Gladstone Institute on behalf of the US National Institutes of Health in six countries: Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.,Nearly 2,500 men and transgender women who have sex with men and were at high risk of HIV infection took part in the study which began in 2007. Half the volunteers were given Truvada and the others were given a dummy pill.,Need for consistency,But Aids experts warned gay and bisexual men and their doctors that drugs did not offer an instant and easy answer. Protection was low in those who did not take them regularly.,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States issued guidance that pre-exposure prophylaxis “should never be seen as the first line of defence against HIV”.,Men who participated in the trials were counselled to use condoms, reduce their number of sexual partners and get tested and treated for other sexually transmitted diseases which can increase the risk of HIV infection.,The big unanswered question is whether drugs can also prevent infection in other at-risk groups, such as women in sub-Saharan Africa whose partners will not use condoms, and drug users.,
,
,The study showed the pill is protective in sex between men, but it does not follow that drugs would protect during heterosexual sex, where the route of transmission is different.,Dr Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC National Centre for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, said the results “represent a major advance in HIV prevention research ... Given the heavy burden of HIV among gay and bisexual men, a new tool with potential additive benefit is exciting and welcome news.”,The findings provided hope that prophylactic drug treatment could protect other at-risk groups around the world. “Given the continued severity of the HIV epidemic, safe and effective new approaches are urgently needed for all populations at risk,” he said.

"One HIV test, but two results","(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/One-HIV-test-but-two-results/article15991286.ece'],)","Elizabeth Pisani,
,
,It's been a bad few months for HIV prevention. We've learned that our best candidates for vaccines and virus-killing microbicides don't work. Now we're clutching at another straw: maybe we can treat our way out of the HIV epidemic.,At an HIV research meeting this week, boffins from the World Health Organisation revived a mathematical model that shows that if we test everyone in Africa for HIV once a year and give everyone who tests positive expensive drugs right away and for the rest of their lives, we'll wipe out new HIV infections within seven years. That's because HIV is passed on most easily when there's lots of virus in the infected person's blood and body fluids. Antiretroviral medicines cut the “viral load” (the amount of virus in the body), so they make it more difficult to pass on HIV. Ergo, more treatment means fewer new infections.,Sadly, it's not that simple. For one thing, HIV is most infectious in the few months after a person is first infected. Even if everyone got tested annually, we'd miss most of these new infections. Second, people's viral load spikes upwards if they get another sexually transmitted infection (STI), or if they stop taking their medicine because the clinic runs out of stock, the meds make them feel sick, or they went on a three-day bender and forgot their pills. Interrupting treatment also allows the virus to develop resistance to drugs, and that leads to more spikes in viral load. Most importantly, antiretrovirals keep you alive and well enough to be out there meeting new sex partners. That's a good thing, obviously, but it also means that people who have HIV are going to have more chances to pass it on during those times when their viral load is spiky.,There's more. In countries like the U.K. where treatment has been available for over a decade, AIDS has virtually disappeared. HIV, unfortunately, has not. A few years after antiretrovirals became widely available, new infections among gay men in the U.K. began to rise. We've seen the same thing in Australia, the United States and practically everywhere else we have data. One reason for that is that gay men use condoms less now than they did when HIV = AIDS = a horrible death. Now, though, HIV = a pill every day. Boring, but not the end of the world, unless you're the taxpayer picking up the tab for it or the epidemiologist worrying that drug-resistant strains of HIV will reignite AIDS.,On top of that, many people assume that if the person they're having sex with is infected, they'll be on meds and so not very infectious. Which may be true if they're not in that early peak of infectiousness, have taken all their pills diligently, and don't have another STI. Though since condom use is dropping across the board, other STI rates are soaring. In short, more people living with HIV, combined with more unprotected sex, is outweighing the effects of lower viral load in places where the population is well informed, HIV testing is actively promoted, and treatment has been free and universally available. But in Africa it will be different.,Our computer model assumes every African will get tested for HIV every year, everyone who tests positive will start taking antiretrovirals immediately and 98 out of 100 will never miss a dose. On top of that, though gay men in rich countries use condoms far less now than they did before we had antiretrovirals, we assume that heterosexuals in Africa are going to use them more once the most visible and frightening face of AIDS disappears.,On the strength of this model, which bears as much relation to reality as a British MP's expense claim, we are going to hail expanded HIV treatment in Africa as the new answer to prevention.

,CHENNAI: With 11 more legal aid clinics for the HIV infected to come up in the State on Wednesday, positive persons in 16 districts of the State will be served by free legal services and counselling.,The districts in which one clinic each will be inaugurated on Wednesday are Chennai, Dharmapuri, Villupuram, Krishnagiri, Salem, Tiruchi, Tirupur, Karur, Theni, Tuticorin and Kanyakumari.,To be set up by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Authority in association with the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, the centres will be manned by an advocate and counsellor appointed by the latter. Each clinic will be set up at a cost of Rs.2 lakh, received as funding from the National AIDS Control Organisation.,The clinics are meant to directly address issues of people living with HIV/AIDS, especially widows, destitute women and children, with sensitivity. They are a step in the direction of providing easy access to legal services wherever anyone has been wronged, or there is a denial of services, according to the policy note.,“Completely free services will be provided at these clinics. There has been a great demand from the districts for such clinics, especially since the first five clinics were able to redress the grievances of people who were infected with HIV and could not afford legal services,” S. Vijayakumar, Project Director, TANSACS, said. Mostly, cases concerning property disputes, alimony and inter-familial disputes come up at the clinics.,So far, the five clinics already set up in Namakkal, Dindigul, Madurai, Cuddalore and Tirunelveli districts have received a total of 1,913 non-legal and 432 legal petitions. Of these, 270 legal petitions and 1,011 non-legal cases have been settled, according to official figures. A substantial percentage of the clients at the legal aid were women. In several instances, disputes have been settled at the mere instance of the counsellor, even before taking the legal route, according to officials."

,VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the country and the coastal region in the State has the densest population of HIV positive people, according to K. Chandramouli, Director-General of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).,Speaking to the media on Monday on the sidelines of his visit to Vasavya Mahila Mandali, a city-based non-governmental organisation working for rehabilitation of HIV infected and affected sections through several community-based care and support programmes, Mr. Chandramouli, however, said that there was a ray of hope, as the incidence of HIV was on the decline across the nation. “The number of cases is coming down and we intend to scale up measures to prevent fresh cases of HIV infection besides providing adequate treatment to those affected by the virus for improving their quality of life,” he said.,Mr. Chandramouli skirted queries by reporters on the alleged misuse of funds allocated to the Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) for implementation of various welfare measures for the HIV-infected and affected population. “Bring to me specific cases and we will enquire into them,” he said.,Vyamavaram.,

,Later, addressing a meeting, the NACO chief spoke about the need for “targeted interventions” to check the spread of virus. He, however, cautioned that these interventions could be tricky. “It needs dedication and patience. You must develop strategies that can be sustained in the long run and can later be linked to the government mechanism,” he said.,Mr. Chandramouli interacted with children’s support groups, members of Prerana Friends’ Club, school and adult support groups, members of Grannies Club, volunteer peer groups and kids from the Children’s Village set up by the VMM at,In a separate interaction with the media, APSACS Project Director R. V. Chandravadan expressed serious concern over the issue of child trafficking. He admitted that child trafficking, along with other issues like the large-scale migrant population, was further contributing to the spread of AIDS in the State and said the Government intended to scale up efforts to keep a check on this degenerating trend.,AIDS Control Officer for Krishna district T.V.S.N. Sastry, National Officer PPTCT Suresh Mohammed, team leader for National Technical Support Unit Rajan, national president of Indian Medical Association G.

South Africa's HIV carer children,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/South-Africas-HIV-carer-children/article16262512.ece'],)","AFRICAN REALITY: Residents look at HIV/AIDS awareness literature during a soccer match in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. — PHOTO: AFP
 
,Not far from the manicured South African pitches where millionaire footballers are capturing the world's attention, Oxford academics are working with local researchers to investigate an African reality that will linger long after the World Cup circus has left. Interviewing more than 7,000 people in some of the country's poorest townships, they are studying the mental health and education of a generation of South African children who are growing up caring for relatives with HIV and Aids.,This is the Young Carers South Africa project, a collaboration between Oxford University, the South African government, and three South African universities, as well as a host of NGOs. The two-year study, involving 35 field staff, including local managers, interviewers and volunteers, is working to build a huge pool of data that will inform social policy not only for South Africa, but for other countries with high rates of AIDS and HIV around the world.,The project is spearheaded by Lucie Cluver, of Oxford's department of social policy and social work, whose inspiration was her PhD research — a study of 1,000 children who had been orphaned by Aids. She discovered that the children suffered higher levels of psychological distress than orphans whose parents had died of other causes, and were also more likely to contract HIV themselves. To raise awareness of the findings, Cluver sent her research to a South African professor, who introduced her to the government's then minister of social development, Zola Skweyiya. The next day he called her to a meeting and said her research “needed to become a national study”, Cluver says.,Two years on, the Young Carers project now has teams in three South African provinces, interviewing 6,000 children and 1,500 of their parents or guardians about their access to social welfare grants, health visitors, and free school meals. With the help of local teenagers, they have made questionnaires that also ask about issues such as stigma and bullying, social support, parent-child relationships and carers' access to anti-retroviral medicine.,“We interview children face-to-face, somewhere private — at home, at school, sometimes in the yard,” says Cluver, “even though some of the sites are only accessible by tiny 20-seater planes or 4x4 vehicles. The interviews are amazing — the kids are often so happy to have someone to talk to about the secret illness in their family. What's difficult is the circumstances in which they live. We've worked through taxi wars and riots in Cape Town, gangsters in Durban, and cholera outbreaks in Mpumalanga. Our researchers walk through open sewers and over rubbish heaps, into homes which desperately poor people keep spotlessly clean.”,Shockingly, so far, the research suggests children who live with AIDS-sufferers have as much psychological distress as those who have been orphaned by AIDS. “It's because of the stigma that comes with having HIV in the family,” Cluver says. “Kids report being gossiped about, and teased, and having people scared to touch them.” The early findings show that about 40 per cent of kids in AIDS-sick homes are missing or have dropped out of school, compared to 22 per cent in homes affected by other illnesses, and 5 per cent in healthy homes. Almost a third of the young carers — sometimes as young as eight — report carrying out intimate care, such as washing sick people, helping them go to the toilet and cleaning their wounds.,“The kids aren't passive victims — they're kids just like all others, wanting to be Beyonce or Usher. They're so excited about the World Cup that when they chose pseudonyms for their stories to be reported in our research, half of them used football players' names,” Cluver says.,“They worry about the same things as first-world kids — one 13-year-old girl cried throughout her interview because kids at school were calling her ‘baboon face'” But when these children get home, “they wash blankets, feed younger siblings, rub the backs of people with tuberculosis, make sure their parents take their anti-retrovirals, miss school for hospital trips, and queue to get medication for their carers who are too sick to stand,” Cluver reports. “When they get to school they're so worried about the sick person at home that they can't concentrate.” More children will face this situation. In 2008, 1.4 million South African children had lost a parent to HIV/AIDS; that's expected to rise above two million by 2015. When I ask Cluver what she hopes to be the impact of her study, her response is passionate: “We don't hope — we'll make something happen: this study is science to serve policy.” The researchers are already giving regular updates to the South African government as well as NGOs such as USAID, Unicef and Child Welfare South Africa. They hold community meetings, and speak to schools, social workers and hospital staff about the issues the kids are raising, and how best to support them. “We're also making two movies — directed, filmed and edited by the kids and their carers — to deal with the stigma surrounding Aids,” says Cluver.,The study aims to reveal the scale of the difficulties faced by HIV/AIDS-affected families. “There has been no large-scale research in the developing world to understand how much work these kids are taking on in the home, and the effects,” Cluver says. “We need to understand if these kids are more depressed, traumatised or anxious than other children, and whether they are struggling at school. We need to know if they're unable to access health services, or are catching illnesses like TB from people they're looking after. Then, we need to know what can help them.” Both the South African government and NGOs are eager for the findings, Cluver says, in order to adapt their policies to help these children. She is hopeful about the study's impact, but admits that in the meantime, the researchers feel powerless.,One 13-year-old told of just folding his arms at lunchtime at school, “because we don't have money to buy food now that my mother cannot work”. An 11-year-old girl described pushing her mum to the clinic in a wheelbarrow, and “bringing her a glass of water because she cannot get out of bed”.,“The parents tell our researchers about horrific experiences and expect to receive help for their situation, but all we can do is give them a biscuit and a certificate. There's nothing we can do but research,” says Cluver. “It's hard to face families who have shared their life stories and then have to walk out of the door.” ,

Drug to control HIV to hit market soon: Kutikuppala,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Drug-to-control-HIV-to-hit-market-soon-Kutikuppala/article16256101.ece'],)","The ‘tenofovir' vaginal gel for woman, a drug to control spread of HIV, would hit the markets in a few months while the ‘rilpivirine' injection is in advanced stages of tests in the US and is expected to reach the market in a couple of years, a local physician and Padma Sree awardee Kutikuppala Surya Rao said. The injection would be a boon to those not interested in taking an oral tablet or apply a gel or an ointment as one dose was enough every six months or a year, Dr. Surya Rao said while giving details about an international conference, M2010 Microbiocies, Building Bridges in HIV Prevention, held in Pittsburgh (US) recently, at a press conference here. Dr. Surya Rao also presented a paper at the conference.,He said the conditions had changed a lot from 90s when an AIDS patient would die soon but now a patient could live 42 years more (from the time he or she contacted the disease) if he or she took the medicines. The concept worldwide on prevention of AIDS and HIV were based on policy of vaginal, oral interference control epidemic (VOICE) study, by taking a tablet or applying a gel and a mathematical model showed that by 2015, the world would be free of AIDS and HIV if one got treatment as soon as he or she contacted the disease.,There are medicines to control the dreaded disease but the high cost was proving to be a burden for people in the Asian and African countries while 85 per cent of the AIDS and HIV patients were living their life full.,Dr. Surya Rao also pointed out that many were not taking the full course of medicines and stopping medication as soon as they saw some improvement.,Circumcision would help a lot in preventing the spread of AIDS and HIV, according to studies made in this area, he said. In South Africa the method reduced the risk of acquiring HIV or STD in 60 per cent of cases.,In a study made by him locally, Dr. Surya Rao said 81 per cent of the 1,000 couples were ready to get their sons circumcised if the procedure was done in a safe manner in a hospital and free of charge or by collecting a nominal amount. Thirteen per cent said they would wait till a report was made on the success of the procedure and six per cent felt that the sexual pressure might drop.,Dr. Surya Rao said treatment of HIV and AIDS must be brought under Arogya Sri scheme. The cost of treatment and medicines would cost around Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 only and poor people could not bear even this amount."

According to Dr. Suniti, it is the stigma which kills people and not the disease.,Being a successful woman in her field, Dr. Suniti has no plans of retirement.

The local NGOs organised meetings of SHGs in which the story tellers from the schools tell stories on stigma/discrimination developed by them based on real life case studies. This sensitization will continue till they agreed to accept the HIV positive people and established social interaction with them.,On a particular date, the SHG women, HIV positive person, preferably women and the story teller used to meet in the village and then started their emotional social interaction. The HIV positive person narrated the agony and pain suffered due to stigma and discrimination as well as the economic hardship suffered by her due to this inhuman social exclusion. Moved by the heart rending history of the affected person, the women share snacks with the affected woman, consoled her and collected money from their savings for her.,So far, the Vasantham Trust has conducted such interaction with more than 75 SHGs. Recently a local NGO, CHARDEP has organised two social interactions in two coastal villages – Enayamputhenthurai and Colachel in which more than 80 women, two HIV positive persons and two story tellers from the schools participated.,C. Chandra Kala, Director of Vasantham Trust said that this program was intended to reduce stigma through creating an enabling social atmosphere.,The ultimate aim was to create Kanyakumari a stigma free district."

,NEW DELHI: People living with HIV/AIDS don’t get life-saving tuberculosis treatment on time and the delay puts their life at risk, according to a recent multi-centre study conducted by the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS with support from Advocacy to Control TB Internationally.,The study indicates significant delays in both detecting and treating TB especially among people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. “Nearly half the 2.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in India contract TB, making it the leading cause of death. Yet less than 5 per cent are automatically tested for TB,” notes the study.,The study also points out that lack of awareness and knowledge about TB ranks high among patients and causes delay in seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Distance from the nearest TB service delivery point is also a key barrier from the provider end, with average travel times exceeding 90 minutes for over 50 p.c. of the population surveyed.,Nearly a third of the surveyed population also reported paying for their medications, indicating an incomplete reach and awareness of the free national TB control programme.,
,
,“People living with HIV/AIDS are among the most vulnerable in getting TB infections. Any delay in this vulnerable population getting life-saving TB treatments is also indicative of broad systemic issues of accessibility that need to be addressed quickly,” said the lead researcher on this study from the Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, Dr. Venkatesan Chakrapani.,“The delay in getting appropriate diagnosis for HIV-infected individuals also reflects on the failure to get newer diagnostic tests on to the market and in our health care delivery points,” he added.,The currently used standard microscopy-based sputum tests fail to detect TB in samples from people living with HIV and having infectious TB, leading to false negative tests and delays in getting a correct diagnosis.,Dr. Bobby John of Global Health Advocates and an adviser on the study said: “There needs to be a further deepening of the service delivery to avoid long travel times for sick people. Distance and poor understanding cause people to drop out of their medications more often than not.”,Ten per cent of the survey participants reported stopping their treatments for a week or more. Incomplete treatment adherence raises the risk of multi-drug resistant TB for the individual and in the community."

,: Massive awareness of HIV/AIDS among youth is essential as young people are vulnerable to it, according to Collector M. Vallalar.,He was inaugurating a district-level ‘Ilavattam,' a youth sports and cultural carnival at the district sports stadium near the Collectorate here on Tuesday.,Youth aged between 15 and 24 constituted around 19 per cent of the population in the state. A recent study revealed that around 73 per cent of young people has misconception about modes of HIV transmission and much of young people's vulnerability stemmed from the poor access to correct information. Gender imbalances, societal norms and economic dependence contributed much to the risk of young people, he said.,What was pathetic thing was that innocent children were affected by HIV, owing to blunders committed by their parents. Youth should not yield to cheap thrills that would spoil their health and life, he advised.,The main objective of the carnival was to normalise HIV among youth and help them understand their vulnerability to this disease.,It would also help youth build leadership and catalyse to fight HIV and AIDS. It would be a unique opportunity for the youth to exhibit their skills and talents.,The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society has plans to create 500 new Red Ribbon Clubs across the state during this carnival.,Already, 986 colleges in the state had RRCs. Dindigul district alone has 35 clubs.,In his special address, Joint Director of Health Services T.

Reason: unavailability of testing kits.,Testing has come to a halt in the past 10 days in all government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC), including Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore. A few centres that still have the kits are testing only emergency cases. This when the State testing centres need at least 4,000 kits a month.,“Many patients are upset. They shout at us and ask us if they have to use a politician's influence,” said V. Prakash, counsellor at Bowring Hospital's ICTC.,“There is shortage across the State. There are 565 ICTCs for the HIV-affected where they are tested for free,” said Fayaz Ahmed, an HIV/AIDS counsellor in an ICTC in Ramanagaram.,Testing kits are crucial because the calculated projection of the number of HIV-infected in the State this year is 2.75 lakh, say activists.,“Only about 1.4 lakh people have been tested at the ICTCs from 2002 till date. Many who suspect they have the disease come only reluctantly for testing. The shortage forces their being turned away, and 80 per cent never turn up again,” said an HIV activist.,“Each of the 565 centres has to test 500 cases every month and we were meeting at least half the target on an average. Now even that is not possible,” he said.,The shortage has badly hit the northern districts of Bijapur, Belgaum and Bagalkot. In the case of Mysore, people have been getting themselves tested in private hospitals for the past two months.

The five-year programme ended in July 2009 and the children living with HIV were left in the lurch. However, based on an appeal from the kendra, the Clinton foundation extended the programme for one more year and provided funds through Citizens Alliance for Rural Development and Training Service (CARDS). This programme would end in July 2010, she said.,Of the 65 children living with HIV in the kendra, 14 aged between 4 and 12, are orphans. The rest have parents and are getting treatment in the kendra under the National Antiretroviral Therapy Programme.,She said the kendra received Rs. 100 for a child from the foundation through ODP to provide food. When the financial aid was stopped in July, the kendra started looking for other donors. “However, obliging to our appeal, the foundation extended the programme by one more year,” she added. There were 75 registered HIV positive children in the district. Though the number of such children was more, it was difficult to identify them in view of the stigma attached to the disease, she said. As the programme would end in six months, the kendra had appealed to donors to make arrangements to support the 14 children. A committee had been formed for the purpose, she said.,Meanwhile, Nagaraj, District AIDS Prevention Programme Nodal Officer, said that free treatment was being provided to the 14 children and it would continue."

,MYSORE: If 22-year-old Seema (name changed) is today a picture of confidence and hope, then kudos to counsellors and doctors at Asha Kirana. Seema after being in and out of government and private hospitals and after wrongly being diagnosed with malaria and typhoid came to Asha Kirana.,There, it was confirmed that she was HIV positive and had tuberculosis. Over the past 20 days, Seema has shown signs of recovery thanks to the medicines and care by the staff and her mother.,“Only my daughter and I know about positive status. If we tell our relatives or people in our village they may ostracise us, as they are not aware of the fact that the disease won’t spread through contact or communication boycott. We’ll just tell them that she has TB,” says Seema’s mother.,What makes matters worse is that Seema has been deserted by her husband. After two miscarriages, her husband left home. “I was married off when I was 12 to my mother’s brother. My father felt that he was dying and wanted to see me settled. My husband was very fond of me, but now…” says Seema wiping away tears. Her mother now suspects that her brother knew that he was positive, but hid it from them. “He worked in Kalasipalya in Bangalore as a daily wage earner and he probably had physical relationships with women there. My daughter is suffering on account of his misdeeds. HIV/AIDS is not something that the poor should get; it’s among the biggest curses on the poor,” she says.,One relief, she continues, is that it is not too late still. “We did find out at the right time and there is still hope of recovery. Asha Kirana has offered to get her remarried or even get her placed with some company. Awareness about the disease and access to care becomes crucial in such cases and we wish many more initiatives are launched. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS should be removed,” says Seema’s mother.,Going by this incident , this year’s theme for World AIDS Day, “Universal Access and Human Rights”, cannot be more apt.,Says Dr. Mothi of Asha Kirana: “WHO had devised a 3/5 plan, according to which 3 million people with HIV/AIDS were to have had universal access by the end of 2005. But despite the availability of money, medicines and manpower this could not be achieved because of lack of awareness. So through this campaign we will all have to work towards creating a comfortable atmosphere where people can come and access care; bringing attitudinal change becomes important.”,Originating as a counselling-cum-care clinic for people living with AIDS (PLWA) in 1997, Asha Kirana has now evolved into a major referral centre in the State. Asha Kirana is the first specialised hospital-cum-research institute for HIV/AIDS, the first to offer subsidised HIV testing and free antiretroviral therapy to children with AIDS, the first voluntary counselling centre, the first healthcare facility to launch outreach programmes in rural and urban areas and the first day-care clinic for PLWA in Mysore region."

One of the key areas that public-private-partnership (PPP) is required is in the area of dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At the session, ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way,’ Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals – Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K. Krishnamoorthy, convenor, Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, said the gap caused by the 5As – accessibility, affordability, availability, acceptability and accountability- could be addressed with good public private partnerships.,Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project (APAC), said the State had come a long way since 1986 when the first cases were detected, but it was true that positive people were still being shunned at hospitals and positive children thrown out from schools.,Andrew Simkin, United States Consul General, concurred and added that a lot remained to be done with regard to social attitudes to HIV. America’s approach to visas had also evolved dramatically, as legislation had enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K. Rajan, Advisor – Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, suggested that all hospitals with 50 beds or more allocate at least five beds for the care of HIV positive people."

,TIRUCHI: The Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS is in the process of forming women’s and men’s self-help groups at the level of taluks.,Formation of men and women SHGs constituting HIV positive members has already been completed in Thuriayur and Musiri, and a women SHG has been formed in Tiruchi.,“We are currently into the task of forming a men SHG in Tiruchi, and women and men SHGs in Lalgudi,” said M. Vijayalakshmi, president of the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS.,Since most of the HIV affected people are shunned by their families and the society, economic emancipation through income generation activities was the purpose behind formation of the SHGs, under the Global Fund Round 4 Access to Care and Treatment (ACT) Project, according to Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,Each group constitutes 12 members and is not an SHG in the real sense of the term. In this case, the members are not required to make any monetary contribution for sustaining membership. The idea is to create a base for seeking the support of the government departments in the form of skills training and self-employment support.,At a recent convention, the members of the network pleaded for their inclusion for the skill- training programmes and self-employment assistance under the schemes of Social Welfare Department, Mahalir Thittam and Thadco.,They have enough reasons to feel that they are cared for by the government machinery. The support of the district administration in expediting the process of widow pension for the HIV affected women has been a cause for immense relief for the network members. HIV patients are also being provided with excellent treatment at the Annal Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital.,“Our concern is that the wrong notion of HIV affliction still persists among the people despite the fact that several widows among the HIV affected members were innocent victims. What we now look for is long-term support through exclusive government schemes directed at economic progress of HIV affected people,” said Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,
,
,To begin with, measures like issue of free house pattas to HIV affected people, priority in issuance of the various certificates, distribution of educational materials to children, marketing support for products developed by them, and inclusion of HIV/AIDS patients under the Chief Minister’s Insurance Scheme for Life Saving Procedures will go a long way in infusing confidence, according to the members of the network, which has been mobilising resources through sponsors to meet the educational expenses of the younger generation."

,CHENNAI: The participation of the private healthcare sector in treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) is extremely crucial for the State to progress towards its goal of no new infections, V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health, said.,While Tamil Nadu has been touted as a model for the rest of the country in HIV prevention, much of the success has been achieved thanks to fruitful partnerships with a number of international agencies, including CDC Atlanta, UNICEF, USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Population Services International, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and UNDP, among others.,
,
,The partnerships have been so successful that international agencies are happy to come to Tamil Nadu, he said. However, Mr. Subburaj said, in the event that international funding shrinks, it is necessary to have adequate internal private participation to sustain prevention efforts. One of the key areas that public-private partnership is required is in dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At a session on ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals — Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K. Krishnamoorthy, convenor, Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, said the gap caused by the 5As — accessibility, affordability, availability, acceptability and accountability — could be addressed with good PPPs. Setting the context for the event, Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project, said the State had come a long way since 1986 when the first cases were detected, but it was true that positive people were still being shunned at hospitals and positive children were being thrown out from schools.,Studies showed that 2.3 per cent of PLHAs complain that doctors and medical staff in the private sector refuse to even touch them in case their positive status is revealed. 89 per cent of positive people employed in the private sector fear that their jobs would be terminated if it got out that they were infected with HIV. “While we have covered the high-risk groups comprehensively, obviously we need to use mass media to approach the entire community with our messages,” he said.,Andrew Simkin, U.S. Consul-General, concurred and added that a lot remains to be done with regard to social attitudes towards HIV. America’s approach to visas has also evolved dramatically, as legislations have enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K. Rajan, Advisor — Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, suggested that all hospitals with 50 beds or more allocate at least five beds for the care of HIV positive people."

I feel that AIDS prevention is of critical importance, and I am sure this train will take this message all over the country and teach people how to prevent this disease and take care of those affected by it through treatment and care.”,Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said: “The train is going to give information on how to prevent HIV/AIDS, where to get services and who to count on for counselling and testing. Between 2002 and 2007, we succeeded in drastically reducing the number of people affected by this disease, and I believe that with more and more information reaching people, we will see a very definite decline in numbers in this country.”,The Red Ribbon Express is being implemented by the National AIDS Control Organisation, the National Rural Health Mission, the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the Ministry of Railways and UNICEF, among others.,The eight-coach train will provide on-station activities through exhibitions and displays.

It will seek to focus on how laws and law enforcement can support, rather than block, effective HIV responses.,“Striking down of Section 377 has been a very important step in this direction and has generated lot of expectations and excitement among the people who are either affected by HIV or those with different sexual preferences,'' J. V. R. Prasada Rao, Member Secretary of the Commission told The Hindu here on Tuesday. Mr Rao, former Union Health Secretary, is at present Special Advisor to the Executive Director of UNAIDS for Asia-Pacific region.,“India's reforms in dealing with HIV, particularly decriminalising consensual same sex preference, access to medicines and even ending social discrimination will definitely be showcased at the global level,'' he said.,The Delhi High Court judgement was the first in India to directly guarantee rights for homosexuals. It overturned a 149-year-old British colonial law, which described sex between members of the same gender as an “unnatural offence.” While larger democracies like India have decriminalised same gender sex and USA and China have removed travel restrictions on HIV positive people, there is growing concern over new “restrictive” legislations on HIV being enacted in 15 countries, including Uganda and some countries in Africa. At present 52 countries have travel restrictions on HIV positive people. This includes India also. The Commission, announced last month, has an 18-month term and will submit its report in December 2011. It will pick up some of the most challenging legal and human rights issues in the context of HIV, including criminalisation of HIV transmission and behaviours and practices such as drug use, sex work and consensual adult same sex relations. “We will also take up women-related issues like marital rape, domestic violence and access to drugs and availability and patenting of generic drugs, though the focus will be on HIV,” Mr Rao said.,The Commission will have three meetings but will be supported by two inter-linked processes: regional hearings (to provide an interface between the Commission and stakeholders) and a Technical Advisory Group (to advise the Commission on key research and inform it on findings and recommendations). Purely an independent body, the Commission will have political leaders, and experts from the field of public health, academicians and judicial experts while the Technical Advisory Group will have AIDS activists including Mandeep Dhaliwal and Vivek Divan from India."
HIV prevention campaign gets a boost,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/HIV-prevention-campaign-gets-a-boost/article16186533.ece'],)","Community mobilisation is one of the major components of the Targeted Intervention programme, visualised by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in its National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III).,Targeted Interventions (TIs) are HIV prevention and control programmes intended for specific groups which are at higher risk of exposure to HIV infection, like female sex workers or truckers or intravenous drug users.,The coverage, scale and quality of the TIs can be enhanced if these ‘at-risk' communities can be brought together to mobilise themselves as community-based organisations and encourage them to head these outfits. The idea is that the pro-active role of female sex workers as a Community Based Organisation (CBO) will certainly make them more responsive to the TI programmes and make them take up the responsibility of HIV prevention,However, mobilisation and empowerment of female sex workers is easily said than done. Many previous attempts to mobilise them into a well-functioning community group has been disappointing,However, the success story of ‘Santhwanatheeram', a community-based organisation of female sex workers, promoted by Jawahar Suraksha Project in Alappuzha, a TI project of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society, in getting together female sex workers and generating in them a sense of responsibility towards HIV prevention and control is an example worthy of replication .,Santhwanatheeram has initiated several programmes to bring together the female sex workers and encourage them to stand united as a community. But it was the process of election to choose the office-bearers of the organisation, which actually brought its members close together. The project utilised the election process as a strategy to mobilise the women and encourage them to come under an umbrella.,The women were encouraged to engage in a healthy competition and to stand for the general body elections. The process resulted in bringing more such women, who were hitherto remaining invisible, into the organisation.,Familiarising them with the democratic election process itself , including declaration of dates for nomination, withdrawal of nomination and canvassing the voters through direct or indirect interaction by candidates, release of election manifesto by panel of candidates etc. served as a capacity-building exercise. Besides, the women had opportunities for public speaking and a platform for leading advocacy.,The members of Santhwanatheeram today are committed workers for the TI projects of the KSACS. They participate in all regular HIV prevention campaigns and are totally committed to the cause they are promoting."

Preliminary figures have indicated that the HIV prevalence was reduced sharply since effective surveillance was in place to prevent transmission from mother to child,” she said.,Ms. Amudha was speaking at the inauguration of new building for Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at the Government Hospital in Melur near here.,She said that the goal of TANSACS was to ensure that there were no new HIV-AIDS infections by the year 2012 and that no child was born with HIV.,“In 2001, the overall prevalence rate of HIV in the State was 1.13 per cent.

As children grow into adults, it is a time for concern for parents, particularly those whose children have tested positive for HIV. The family comes together to work out strategies to break the bad news.,This is a common dilemma almost every household faces today. Until the children are grown and not on anti-retroviral drugs, they face no worry or discrimination, but once the sexually active age is reached, things become difficult.,With the HIV infection having spread into the community, through the exchange or re-use of infected syringes and the unsafe sexual practices that have infected many women, now, the large number of children infected or affected by HIV poses a serious challenge to society as well as government.,Rough estimates suggest that Manipur has 6,500 children who are affected (orphaned or abandoned with their mothers by families due to the stigma attached with HIV) by the killer infection. Taking up the challenges, several non-governmental organisations have come forward to take care of these children by providing help with treatment and education.,The Manipur Network of Positive People (MNP +) started its education support to children infected and affected with HIV/AIDS in January last year. The initiative began with 44 children of Classes I to XII, who would otherwise have dropped out as their parents had little or no earning, besides having spent most of their savings on treatment.,Today, the programme supports 93 children and covers all nine districts in the State. Imphal West has 11, Imphal East 14.

The MNP + has a tie-up with some local hospitals where these children are generally referred to. With awareness about the programme spreading, many individuals and philanthropic organisations have also started chipping in.,Another non-governmental organisation, Catholic Relief Service is providing education support to 210 affected children. Under the programme, children are provided Rs. 500 for admission, Rs. 700 for school uniform, textbooks and a set of exercise books, and a monthly school tuition fee of Rs. 100.,Even as the State and society struggle to rehabilitate children with HIV and AIDS, they are confronted with the yet other challenge of Hepatitis C, which has assumed epidemic proportions.,According to the Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment conducted by the ICMR and Family Health International in two Manipur districts — Bishnupur and Churachandpur — the prevalence of the Hepatitis C virus was alarmingly high among the injecting drug-users."

There were several who want to give up but did not know how to go about it.,“Maybe Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) — an alternative that reduces drug abuse and overdose and other infections — could be the answer,” says Mr. Nishikanta.,The National Aids Control Organisation has initiated OST at nine centres in Manipur, wherein heroin and spasmoproxyvon is replaced by buprenorphine which is given orally and hence reduces infections and abscesses and counselling at these centres helps people give up drugs for good.,A large number of visitors at this drop-in centre have gone for voluntary testing at the local hospital and detected to be HIV-positive. While the Indians are put on free anti-retroviral therapy treatment (ART), those from Myanmar do not get such facility.

,Madikeri: India is the home to the third largest number of HIV positive people in the world, characterised by widespread migration and mobility, it was revealed at a sensitisation programme on HIV, AIDS, involving migrant labour at a private plantation at Galibeedu, near here.,Organisers of a sensitisation programme, Asha Kirana and HOPES Trust, on Tuesday last called upon the plantation owners in Kodagu district to extend support to the programmes to generate awareness among the labour on the pernicious effects of the disease.,More than two million Indians did not live in the place of their birth. Migrants became vulnerable owing to several reasons such as dissociation from families, and sexual partners for long. It was important to note that all migrants were at equal risk, a statement received from Asha Kirana, Mysore, and HOPES Trust, Kodagu, said on Thursday.,One such programme called Targeted intervention project in Kodagu district was held at the private plantation. It was supported by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society, in association with the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), according to a statement from the organisers.,The statement said that there were over 2,000 coffee plantations in Kodagu and there were around 40,000 migrants in the district in the coffee season, of which 70 per cent would be men.,The sensitisation programme would help analyse the perceived HIV, AIDS risk management among migrant labour. Conducting awareness programmes through the media, community participation, street plays and other means such as information and education would go a long way in mitigating the impact of HIV, AIDS.,A positive network for HIV, AIDS did not exist in Kodagu, the statement said.,Women migrants were largely at risk due to the possibility of engaging in transactional sex either through coercion or to supplement their income. As far as men were concerned, relative freedom in a new setting as well as peer pressure to experiment with new norms or distress migration driven by seasonal droughts or disasters, loneliness, drudgery were some of the reasons. The lack of HIV, AIDS awareness, information and social support network were some of the reasons that exposed the migrant workers to risk.,Jnanamani Nanaiah, district AIDS nodal officer, who inaugurated the programme, highlighted the various modes of transmission of HIV, preventive measures and facilities available from the Government.,Swamy of Asha Kirana and Arathy Somaiah of HOPES Trust spoke."

They will attend their first special conference this week to share experiences and call for international recognition of their uniquely difficult circumstances.,A summit of grandparents in the West might prompt jokes about bingo and dentures, but the inaugural African Grandmothers' Gathering, starting in Swaziland on Thursday, is a gravely serious affair.,More than 450 grandmothers from 12 African countries will meet to discuss the impact of losing adult children to AIDS, becoming the head of a household and raising grief-stricken grandchildren as their own.,These forgotten victims hope to build a “solidarity movement” across Africa to make the case that grandmothers need targeted support from international donors.,A lost voice,“It's a lost group, a lost voice,” said Philile Mlotshwa of Swapol (Swaziland Positive Living), which is organising the event in partnership with the Canadian-based Stephen Lewis Foundation . “They are the heroes yet no one has gone to them to say we recognise your efforts.” The organisers say it is time to heed the “indomitable and indefatigable” grandmothers who step forward to care for children, sometimes as many as 10 to 15 in one household. “They are holding together the social fabric of communities across the continent.” Ms Mlotshwa continued: “Grandparents have always played an important role in solving disputes and as a source of knowledge. But now the younger generation is not there: people aged 29 to 49 are dying from HIV-AIDS ... Grandmothers are at the frontline of the HIV-AIDS impact. They have to pick up the pieces and move on. They don't have time to grieve because the children need to be looked after. They are doing this without any income.,In spite of challenges,“They are sick with diabetes and high blood pressure. We are seeing women who are carrying on in spite of the challenges and the fear of what will happen to these grandchildren if they die.” Ms Mlotshwa said she hoped the gathering would raise awareness of grandmothers' needs. “Various responses to HIV-AIDS have been designed but not yet targeted at them.” The grandmothers are likely to seek international support for grief counselling, access to healthcare for themselves and children in their care, safe and adequate housing, economic security, safety from gender-based violence, raising community awareness and breaking stigma, support in raising grief-stricken grandchildren and access to education for children.,Grandmothers from Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe will be represented.,Stephen Lewis, chair of the foundation, said: “Grandmothers [are] the unsung heroes of Africa. These magnificently courageous women bury their own children and then look after their orphaned grandchildren, calling on astonishing reserves of love and emotional resilience.”"
