‘Doc, do I have AIDS?'
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lsquoDoc-do-I-have-AIDS/article15709881.ece,"‘Rule out first, rather than regret later' is the mantra. However, some people constantly fear they might be suffering from some ailment. Neeraja Murthy reports,This may sound like the story of your life. You spend long hours in front of the computer, have a cushy job and are chilled out with a fast-paced lifestyle. But, there is one botheration - you are fit and fine but feel you might be suffering from some ailment. Your negative laboratory tests do not convince you and you change the doctor in the hope of a satisfactory reply. Welcome to the world of ‘Doubting Thomases' who have wealth and comfort but no peace of mind because of constant fear. “It is basically a psychological disorder. They are called hypochondriacs and the other disorder is Munchausen's Syndrome,” states psychiatrist G. Prasad Rao. Dictionary defines Munchausen's Syndrome ‘as a mental disorder in which a person repeatedly feigns severe illness so as to obtain hospital treatment.',“These people are quite internet-savvy and have similar characteristics. They are always seen visiting specialists with a bag filled with reports, ECGs, X-rays, scans and tests. Instead of facing the reality of visiting a psychiatrist for therapy, they suffer and in turn the family suffers too. They are even nick-named ‘Dr Shoppers',” says the doctor. Awareness campaigns and the importance given to ‘how-to-be-healthy' stories on the small screen and newspapers have made a positive sea change in the mindset.,The mantra is to ‘rule out first rather than regret later.' “This is quite a good trend but these health freaks pick only things they like and try to compare them with their body changes. Like, if they have been visiting the bathroom quite often, they suspect they might be diabetic. Frequent urination is only one of the symptoms of diabetes. Symptoms do not always mean that one has the problem,” says homoeo consultant Dr. Venugopal Gouri. He says these people have extremes of moods and are paranoid and anxious all the time.,Even as psychiatrists say men and women are equally prone to this disorder, Dr. Venugopal feels women might be more affected as they are more stressed-out than men (due to multi-tasking) and hormonal changes.,Hiral, a counsellor working at KIMS and Lotus Children's Hospital, says these disorders should not be mistaken with lies told by children to bunk school. “Some kids often pretend to have stomach ache to avoid going to school. That could be due to fear of getting the report card or writing some test.”,Hiral also says counsellors face a lot of challenges including non-cooperation by clients. Recalling an incident, she says, “One client had undergone a blood transfusion. He got high fever and was convinced that he had AIDS. I tried to counsel him but he was not happy with my sessions as I did not tell him what he wanted to hear.”,Infertility expert Dr. Roya Rozati has the final word though. “Just because some people have some disorder, it should not stop others from updating themselves about different health-related issues. If there is no awareness, there is every possibility that they know about an ailment at a last stage. Not just that, some quacks with incomplete knowledge might also take them for a ride.”"

To reduce stigma in interacting with HIV affected

The credit for this humane act goes to the story telling club members in different parts of the district.,The members of the self help groups have been involved in reducing stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS among the school children and the community through story telling clubs in schools.,The story tellers from the 36 story telling clubs in the schools have already completed the sensitization of 18,500 school children against the stigma through story telling sessions. The impact had already been assessed through interaction of HIV positive persons and the school children. Now it has shifted the focus to the villages, particularly the Self Help Group women promoted by the local NGOs.,The modus operandi is simple but effective. The local NGOs organised meetings of SHGs in which the story tellers from the schools tell stories on stigma/discrimination developed by them based on real life case studies. This sensitization will continue till they agreed to accept the HIV positive people and established social interaction with them.,On a particular date, the SHG women, HIV positive person, preferably women and the story teller used to meet in the village and then started their emotional social interaction. The HIV positive person narrated the agony and pain suffered due to stigma and discrimination as well as the economic hardship suffered by her due to this inhuman social exclusion. Moved by the heart rending history of the affected person, the women share snacks with the affected woman, consoled her and collected money from their savings for her.,So far, the Vasantham Trust has conducted such interaction with more than 75 SHGs. Recently a local NGO, CHARDEP has organised two social interactions in two coastal villages – Enayamputhenthurai and Colachel in which more than 80 women, two HIV positive persons and two story tellers from the schools participated.,C. Chandra Kala, Director of Vasantham Trust said that this program was intended to reduce stigma through creating an enabling social atmosphere.,The ultimate aim was to create Kanyakumari a stigma free district."

Sonalee, Managing Trustee, Transgender Community Action Network, and K. Jeyapal of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at Annal Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital here.,Creating youth awareness is of vital importance at this juncture to keep the disease at bay, she said, pointing out that the disease wiped out people in the prime of youth.,Emphasising on peer counselling to face the challenge, Ms. Thamil felt there was no reason for the younger generation to feel ashamed of HIV/AIDS. Voluntary testing before marriage was as important as horoscope matching since, in numerous cases, women realised that they have been afflicted by the disease only during pregnancy.,Ms. Sonalee exhorted the society to consider transgenders as women. Neglect by own families is the prime cause for the social exclusion of transgenders, she said, observing that their predicament was precipitated by denial of jobs.,Explaining the chromosome factor as the determiner of physical and mental conditions of an individual, she said leading a pitiable life was not a matter of choice for transgenders. Ms. Sonalee lauded the Government’s initiatives to create a welfare board for transgenders and provide them with ration cards as right steps.,Mr. Jeyapal explained that the disease spread through unsafe sex, syringes and blood transfusion. There were methods to prevent mother-to-child transmission in the womb. Anti-retroviral drugs were available in all district headquarters hospitals, he said. RRC Programme Officer S. Vijayarani and Youth Red Cross Programme Officer Dhanalakshmi also took part in the panel discussion."

“HIV-TB co-infection increasing”

The government was trying to address this by increasing the special attention paid to these districts. The reason Tamil Nadu has not made significant progress in addressing TB-HIV is because it has not been integrated into the public health system. He was speaking at the launch of the Global Fund Round 9 programme for civil society engagement organised in the city by REACH on Wednesday.,The State will also consider a proposal to introduce a multi-sectoral approach within various health departments to address the issues posed by TB, its detection, treatment, cure and resistant strains. At the local level, the health inspectors have been instructed to be involved with and take responsibility for all diseases that occur at the village level.,Another problem is that the TB control units are small and suffer from manpower shortage. The government is trying to address that as well, by posting qualified personnel in the labs and PHCs.,Mr. Subburaj stressed that emphasis must be given on the need to stick through the course of the drug regimen, in order to avoid drug-resistant TB. What would be a six-month treatment period gets extended to two years, with more complications if drug resistance develops, he added.,Rajesh Lakhoni, Chennai Corporation Commissioner, said the tendency among persons detected with TB to go into denial first, leads to delay in taking up treatment. It was also important to stick to the regimen prescribed throughout the period of six months.,“Despite all our efforts to reach out, the city continues to have a defaulter rate of about seven to eight per cent. In order to improve the case detection rate, we are going to have 155 detection centres in the city in the next six to eight months,” he added. Also, the Corporation's helpline 1913 can also be used to arrange for collection of blood at the doorstep itself.,P.Kuganantham, Health Officer, Chennai Corporation, said the civic body intends to mainstream HIV and TB detection and treatment activities."

The NACO’s decision to further decentralise the programme during NACP-III has given birth to District AIDS Prevention and Control Units (DAPCUs).,“This is aimed at optimisation of scarce resources and the provision of seamless services to those in need of medical assistance at the grass-root level and also for ensuring long term sustainability of the interventions,” says T.V.S.N. Sastry, Additional District Medical & Health Officer and AIDS and Leprosy Officer for Krishna district.,The DAPCU, which will come into existence in Krishna district from April 1, will have the freedom to design need-based programmes based on the prevailing local circumstances. Under the DAPCU, the district will form health societies with the Collector as chairman.,“As far as Krishna district is concerned, the DAPCU will focus on the patients put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART),” says Mr. Sastry, informing that besides the existing ART centre on the premises of Siddhartha Medical College, one more centre would come up at Machilipatnam by March. “This will reduce the burden on the centre at Vijayawada. We have also asked for establishment of link centres at Gudivada and Nuzvid,” he says, explaining that once that happens, people will not have to travel long distance for treatment as the nearest local centre will take care of their medical needs. Krishna district currently has 4,500 HIV positive people put on ART.,

,For effective treatment of sexually transmitted infections, new STI clinics (total nine in the district) are also coming up. “The government is ready to provide the STI kits to even private clinics. STI clinics will have separate counsellors, infrastructure and a whole new set-up to exclusively focus on the problem,” he says.,Speaking about the general scenario in the district, Mr. Sastry says there has been a steady decline in the ‘positive’ cases in the last five years. “Our aim is to bring it to zero level. The sharp decline in HIV positive cases among antenatal to 1.6 per cent against 7.2 per cent five years ago gives us a bright ray of hope,” he says optimistically."

He was also the first one to be tested for the infection. “According to World Health Organisation, every 12th person in the world is a carrier of the virus. While there are vaccines to cure the B infection, the virus that spreads Hepatitis C kills four times more people than even HIV,” said T.S. Chandrasekar, hospital founder.,The hospital is observing Hepatitis Awareness Week as part of an ongoing movement initiated by World Hepatitis Alliance. The theme for this year’s World Hepatitis Day, observed on Tuesday, was ‘Am I number 12?’,Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by various viruses, seriously damages the liver and can eventually lead to hospitalisation, liver cancer and liver transplantation. “Most people are unaware that they are carriers of the infection as they remain asymptomatic. Hepatitis C spreads through blood, body fluid, sexual contact and unsterilised instruments used for piercing ears or tonsuring. Transfusion of blood and blood products are other routes for the transmission of the virus,” Dr. Chandrasekar said.,“The cure rate is 80 to 85 per cent but the infection itself is preventable. Blood tests would enable to find asymptomatic persons and treat them,” he said.,Anyone who has had jaundice, whose family members have had the disease, who have had invasive procedures, have asthma or are using insulin injections to control diabetes should get tested, he said.,About 500 people were screened at Saturday’s camp.

PRASAD,Two years after starting the antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infected people with a CD4 count less than 200, efforts are under way to understand drug resistance.,A threshold survey to understand drug resistance in people who have been recently infected was done last year in Mumbai and Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.,A threshold survey is a preliminary study undertaken to check for drug resistance. It is done to see if a full-fledged large-scale study for drug resistance needs to be undertaken. The threshold survey undertaken in Mumbai included 47 HIV-infected individuals. “Only one person showed drug resistant mutation,” said Dr. R. Paranjape, Director of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune. “This indicates very low drug resistance.”,In the case of Kakinada, 57 samples have been collected. Only ten have been tested, and none of the ten samples has shown any drug resistant mutation.,The very low prevalence of drug resistance in Mumbai indicates that drug resistant virus is not circulating in the general population.,But Dr. Paranjape is cautious about drawing any conclusions based on the Mumbai results alone. “The result is from just one city,” he said. “And the possibility of some people who have not been recently infected being a part of the survey cannot be ruled out.”,
,
,Another study to study the prevalence of drug resistance in people who are on ART was started last year in Chennai and Mumbai. Hundred and fifty patients from each city were enrolled.,The plasma viral load to know the level of HIV in blood was done at the start of the one-year study.,Patients on ART should show reduced viral load. “Plasma viral load test will be done in those patients in whom the viral load has gone up,” Dr. Paranjape said.,Most of the patients in both the cities have completed one year after the initial viral load test. “Hopefully we will have the data in another 2-3 months,” he said.,The initiative to study drug resistance has been jointly undertaken by World Health Organisation (WHO), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Delhi and NARI, Pune."

,CHENNAI: As part of observing International Women’s Day a number of organisations working with persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) came together on Tuesday to provide a forum for PLHA to articulate their grievances.,From property rights, marital rights, family issues, disclosure of positive status to discrimination at hospitals, a range of problems were brought to the open at the public hearing organised by World Vision, Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS and South Indian AIDS Action Program.,One of the foremost grievances was related to widow pension. The epidemic had rendered many women widows looking after young children without any other support structure. Getting a widow pension was difficult and women had to run from pillar to post to apply for and secure the pension, they said.,One of the members of the jury Shanthakumari, president, Madras Women Lawyers Association, said in response that women widowed by HIV do not have to follow the regular age criteria that applies to other beneficiaries. The usual criteria had been relaxed by the government. She suggested that a Public Interest Litigation petition be filed to get a court order to the same effect.,Children who have been orphaned by the disease are taken care of by relatives if they will inherit the property of their parents. Most other times, the family forsakes the child who is then admitted into an orphanage or home. Again, the treatment meted out to the boy or girl in the home is not always good. Something must be done to ensure their safety and happiness, a representative of a positive person’s network said. Many women brought up the issue of remarriage and sought clarifications on right legal process to follow then. Members of the Indira Female Peer Educators Collective, an advocacy group for the rights of women in sex work, complained about the harassment they faced from the police. Even those who were now involved in HIV/AIDS intervention work were being arrested if condoms were found in their bags, Babyma of IFPEC narrated.,One of the panel members Angeline, advocate, urged that positive women come together to constitute a forum that will advance their rights, legal and social, throughout the State. Other members on the panel included Karthigai Priya, medical officer, Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram, Bharathi Thambi, journalist, and Revathy Kirubakaran, professor, Government Arts College, Chengalpet.,Earlier, Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project, inaugurated the public hearing.

As a journalist she has the credit of bringing out a scoop on the circumstances surrounding the death of Che Guevara and her prized possession till date is the unfired bullet from Che’s M-16 rifle. She also founded a literary magazine ‘Libre’ that published the works of several Latin American writers, namely Plinio Mendoza, Carlos Franqui, Octavio Paz, Claribel Allegria, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes.,In a chat, the countess recollects what made her sell her family fortune to back the children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. She says, “My son was a helicopter rescue pilot and he died on a rescue mission in Mali. He was 24. To give a fitting response to his values, I took up this work. Motivated by Dr. J. Mann’s interview on the HIV/AIDS outbreak, which would leave behind millions of orphans, I thought that I could do something to reduce their sufferings.”,In 1989, she along with her family and friends founded the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud International (FXB International), in the name of her late son. “FXB offers support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The overall strategy of FXB is the practical implementation of the link between health and human rights in the daily lives of its 16 million beneficiaries across nations. Today, FXB counts more than 100 programmes in 18 countries, including 33 FXB-Villages,” says Albina.,She came to India 18 years ago. “Given its diverse cultural fabric, to start work on an issue still considered a taboo was not easy. Poverty, commercial sex work, migrant workers and the vast population of truckers contribute largely to the spread of the disease. If the governor of one state allowed me to start my work the other threw the spanner in my spokes. But despite all odds, we have been able to take the initiative under the FXB Suraksha programme and could establish five FXB villages in different states,” says she.,Appreciating the work done by the government’s in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, she points out that in many of the states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the survey has not been done properly to assess the scenario.,The FXB villages are located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh; Aizawl, Mizoram; Imphal, Manipur; Dhapa-Tangra, West Bengal; and Medinipur, West Bengal. Each village supports about 80 to 100 families by providing basic package, comprising healthcare, education, nutrition support and psychological support.,FXB Suraksha is also into counselling of pregnant women to stop the transmission of the virus from mother-to-child.

The news of closure has landed them between the devil and the deep blue sea.

The chances are even both put together will not provide the care and satisfaction they avow they get at ARCON.,Rupkar says: “Even after spending Rs. 25,000 per shot, the doctors at the hospital I went to told me that they were helpless and no further treatment was possible for my son. That is when I shifted to ARCON.”,Here, the staff treats patients like family. Medicines are not the only cure for HIV/AIDS. Counselling plays a major role. There are so many male patients, whose spouses have not contracted HIV/AIDS.,Over the years, the research at ARCON has resulted in 25 published articles and 15 books. The calibre of its staff receives instant endorsement from patients. They also commend the service and the humane approach to treatment.,Despite its good track record, project director Abhay Chowdhary has let ARCON die its own death.

There is a graded pricing pattern where patients are slotted into four economic categories. The well-off pay and the poorest don’t. “We do not find patients who are willing to pay. So this model of graded pricing is not sustainable.”,He also sees no point in worrying over the patients. They can always go to the free NACO [National AIDS Control Organisation] centres, he proposes.,The patients are not amused.,Roy Mhatre (name changed), an ARCON patient since 2000, discards this solution right away. “Just see the condition of the government centres. At the JJ Hospital, I wait for three hours only for a blood test. An HIV/AIDS patient has to make three to four visits in a month. Do you expect a patient, in pain, to wait that long? Plus, if one has to stand in a line for that long when will one work?” he thunders.,By Maharashtra Higher and Technical Education Minister Rajesh Tope’s own admission, the NACO centres are crowded.,Dr. Chowdhary’s estimate of affected patients obfuscates the impact of the problem. “Only 372 who are on Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) will be affected. We do not have 10,000 patients.”"

,HYDERABAD: At least for a month, Vijaylakshmi’s father Babu Rao need not worry about his daughter’s special dietary needs. The auto driver hopes that the temporary respite from struggle to organise nutritious food will help save money for future needs. The relief is less but it’s worth it. On Sunday, nearly 100 children like Vijaylakshmi, all HIV-positive children due to transmission from their parents, received nutritious food items like ragi malt, wheat mixed with nutritional supplements and doles of dry fruits. The provisions were handed over to them by NGO Access and Network of HIV positive Persons (NHP) at Erragadda Chest Hospital.,
,
,“I am trying to save money to send her to a private school next year. She keeps falling sick and is frail to play for long periods,” Babu Rao says, as Vijaylakshmi plays on his lap. At another corner, eight-year-old Rashida is held firmly by her mother Afroze in her lap. “She likes to run but because of hot summer she has already fallen twice with heat stroke,” she says. Making arrangements for children’s education, nutrition and drugs supply is a struggle for parents.,“Functions like these help us a lot. A similar programme, held last month here at Chest Hospital, helped us a lot. We also get a fair idea from experts on what to feed and what to avoid in such programmes,” says P. Mahesh, who brought his son to the programme.,Representatives of NGO-Access informed that a similar exercise would be taken up in April in Chest Hospital. “We have done such programmes in Chittoor district. Now we are trying to work actively in Hyderabad,” said Sudha Kiran of the NGO."

Her area of work is with the HIV/AIDS orphans worldwide. Speaking of the disease’s wide-ranging impact including in India, her humanitarian work through her NGO, FXB, her voice is warm as she says, “It is heart-warming to see that my work has been able to rescue people.”,Albina, who started World AIDS Orphans Day on May 7 to attract world attention towards over 15 million children orphaned by the disease so far, named FXB after her son Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, a pilot who died at 24 during a helicopter-borne rescue mission in West Africa.,“I formed FXB to carry on what he would have loved to do if he had been alive,” she says. Since 1989, FXB has gone to 35 countries. It came to India in 1991, though it registered itself as an NGO in 2007 with the suffix Suraksha. “Today, FXB Suraksha is working in all the Indian States,” she says with a beaming smile. The issue of HIV/AIDS orphans “is the next biggest epidemic,” she underlines. “Every minute, four children are orphaned by AIDS worldwide.” Her target base is those infected by HIV/AIDS and too poor to tend to their health needs and support their families economically. Albina reasons, “Poverty is a double scourge. They are the most vulnerable lot.” FXB Suraksha works directly with the affected families to better their income. It places the orphans in a caring, stable home ensuring access to healthcare and education. This, it achieves through its FXB villages.,
,
,She explains, “What we do at FXB villages has now been validated by experts from UNICEF and UNAIDS. Each village provides 80 to 100 families with a basic package of health, education, psychosocial support and opportunities to earn income. We provide resources and training for it.” Currently, the villages are in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Aizawl (Mizoram), Imphal (Manipur) and Dhapa-Tangra and Medinapur (West Bengal). FXB supports these families for three years during which it encourages the community’s participation for their own welfare.,Albina though notes from her experience, “In India, people wait for the Government to better their lives rather than looking at themselves as partners of the process. Indians are so creative, so inventive, I am sure they can do a lot if they really think about it.” Creating awareness is definitely an effective way of fighting it. “To achieve it, we regularly create role models in the local communities, it helps people to come forward.”,Albina wants to take the FXB village concept to other States but points out, “Funds are an issue”.,

,
,“ We have only three ART centres in the State. We want such centres to come up in every district. There is no provision for second line treatment. While many women have advanced to critical stage after being affected by HIV positive, political leaders should show consensus and make provision for second line treatment,” said Namita Nanda, president of Shradha, a network of HIV-affected women.,She said Rs. 200 was being given to disabled, widow and HIV-affected persons under Madhubabu Pension Yojna, but HIV positive women were finding it difficult to manage with the paltry sum. The amount should be raised to Rs. 500, Ms. Nanda, who did not want to hide her name, demanded.,“It becomes doubly cruel in case of children. What did happen when HIV-positive parents of a child died? There is nobody to look after him. Political leaders should prepare a mechanism to shelter these orphaned children and the mechanism should be implemented whoever would come to power,” she demanded.,Similarly, Binita Rout (name changed) from Ganjam district came down heavily on Union Government for not passing the HIV/AIDS bill which would have taken care of all concerns of HIV positive persons.,“We are facing stigma in our everyday life. Society treats us with discrimination. Women are living in such a disadvantaged position so that they cannot muster courage to raise their voice,” Ms. Rout said.,These women would present their charter of demands to leaders of different political leaders on Monday."

Subramanian flagged off the rally and launched the camp organised by MedIndia Hospitals. He was also the first one to be tested for the infection. “According to World Health Organisation, every 12th person in the world is a carrier of the virus. While there are vaccines to cure the B infection, the virus that spreads Hepatitis C kills four times more people than even HIV,” said T.S. Chandrasekar, hospital founder.,The hospital is observing Hepatitis Awareness Week as part of an ongoing movement initiated by World Hepatitis Alliance. The theme for this year’s World Hepatitis Day, observed on Tuesday, was ‘Am I number 12?’,Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by various viruses, seriously damages the liver and can eventually lead to hospitalisation, liver cancer and liver transplantation. “Most people are unaware that they are carriers of the infection as they remain asymptomatic. Hepatitis C spreads through blood, body fluid, sexual contact and unsterilised instruments used for piercing ears or tonsuring. Transfusion of blood and blood products are other routes for the transmission of the virus,” Dr. Chandrasekar said.,“The cure rate is 80 to 85 per cent but the infection itself is preventable. Blood tests would enable to find asymptomatic persons and treat them,” he said.,Anyone who has had jaundice, whose family members have had the disease, who have had invasive procedures, have asthma or are using insulin injections to control diabetes should get tested, he said.,About 500 people were screened at Saturday’s camp. Those who underwent the test were provided cards that would allow them to approach the hospital for a master liver check up."

The two friends who came to the beach spared a few minutes with Jenice, a staff of the Madras Christian Council of Social Service (MCCSS) that had organised the event. She explained to them the various routes of transmission of the virus.,In contrast, a sea shells seller did not hesitate when requested to participate in the event. Not only did he know the seriousness of contracting the infection but also empathised with those infected. He did not want to talk about his friend who, he said, had been diagnosed with AIDS six years ago and refused to take medicines.,“Now he has turned to alcohol. I don’t want to talk about it. It is his life and I have no business discussing it with others,” the visibly upset man said when asked why he agreed to place his thumb impression.,Barnabas Pravin, a social work trainee from the Madras Christian College, who was part of the MCCSS team said: “There are two sets of people. One set does not want to take medicines and the other set copes with life and tries to help by joining non-governmental organisations to spread the message.”,Every year, the third Sunday of May is observed as memorial day for those who lost their lives to AIDS.,The MCCSS, which works with slum dwellers in Chennai, proposes to collect around 500 thumb impressions as part of the Memorial Day.,At the end of the event on Thursday, candles were lit in memory of those who had died of the infection."

Treating TB, AIDS co-infection
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/Treating-TB-AIDS-co-infection/article15951357.ece,"R. PRASAD,The viral load reduction was highest in the Efaviranz group,
,
,
,
,The Phase IV trial started in June 2006 to treat patients simultaneously for both TB and HIV has returned some important results. The trial once again reinforced the need to treat the afflicted for both the diseases simultaneously.,According to earlier guidelines, patients were to be treated for TB before treatment for AIDS could begin. Unfortunately 20 per cent of patients die in the first year, and another 20 per cent in the second year in the absence of AIDS treatment. This necessitated a change in the strategy — treat patients for AIDS even as TB treatment is under way.,
,
,This trial is proof that treating both the diseases at the same time is good for patients. The cure rate was 90 per cent when patients were treated for both the diseases. Compare this with the earlier strategy of treating only for TB, even when co-infected with HIV. The cure rate was at best 72 per cent. The low cure rate when treated only for TB was because many were dying or failing to respond to TB treatment.,“The lower cure rate [when only TB was treated] was probably due to progression of AIDS,” said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Senior Deputy Director (Division of HIV/TB), Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai. Dr. Swaminathan was the trial investigator. Apart from the cure rate, only five of the 119 patients in the trial died compared with 9-10 per cent mortality as reported in other studies when only TB was treated.,This trial provided the answers to some of the critical issues as well. It was earlier considered that TB symptoms would flare up when a person with TB was given antiretroviral therapy (ART) for AIDS.,Also, treating patients with Nevirapine (an AIDS drug) when already on Rifamycin, a TB drug, would be a problem. That is because Rifamycin induces some enzymes which in turn metabolise Nevirapine. Hence the level of Nevirapine in the blood drops, making it very favourable for HIV to mutate and develop drug resistance.,Apart from showing that it was indeed possible to treat for both the diseases simultaneously, the trial showed the safety and possibility of using Nevirapine even when the patient was on Rifamycin.,The trial had two arms (groups). One arm was given Efavirenz plus two other AIDS drugs and the other got Nevirapine and two other AIDS drugs. Both the arms got the TB drug, Rifamycin.,“Our study showed that it is indeed safe to give Nevirapine when on Rifamycin,” said Dr. Swaminathan. “Nevirapine also brought down the mortality.”,While the HIV viral load in both the arms saw a reduction to less than 400 copies per ml, the percentage of people who showed the reduction was as high as 85 in the case of the arm that got Efavirenz. It was 67 per cent in the arm that got Nevirapine.,
,
,The unexpected finding was that the cure rate was 84 per cent in the case of patients who got Nevirapine. The Efaviranz arm had cure rate of 95 per cent.,“The reason for the poor performance [in the case of Nevirapine arm] could most likely be drug interaction between Rifamycin and Nevirapine,” she said. Only 200 mg of Nevirapine is given during the first two weeks before increasing it to 400 mg. “The poor performance could be due to the suboptimal levels of Nevirapine in the blood during the first two weeks of treatment,” she said.,Despite the reduced efficacy, Nevirapine is the best bet in certain cases — pregnant women and psychiatric patients cannot be given Efaviranz."

Over 3000 HIV positives have been registered in Kakinada ART centre and out of which there are 700 dropout cases who are not turning up at the centre due to failure of follow-up and concentrated monitoring by doctors.,The second ART centre at Rajahmundry, which opened almost six months ago, is yet to open its account as there is no medical officer to look after it. The efforts of district AIDS nodal officer to bring a doctor to the centre failed and pressure on Kakinada centre mounts due to awareness in HIV positives in recent times.,According to Dr. Pavan Kumar, nodal officer for HIV/AIDS, the percentage of HIV cases is 8.56 per cent till July last year, but there is little alarming in the case of anti-natal positive cases where the percentage is 18.4. Among the 44,794 cases tested, the pregnant women with HIV positive are 8,233.,However, it is shocking that the HIV is spreading in agency areas also in East Godavari.,The district nodal agency has identified 45 anti-natal cases and spoke to ITDA project officer Yogita Rana to bring them to Kakinada ART centre for treatment. Apart from these cases, positives among the tribal men are also in good number, who are not coming to testing centres.,

,“We want to strengthen outreach workers network first to track down 700 dropouts and take follow-up case by case. We also want to see that Rajahmundry centre should also function to minimise the pressure on Kakinada.” However, he has admitted that there is shortage of ART drugs, which are very costly, in the beginning, but it is sorted out. But, NGOs, who are working in this field, are complaining that second line treatment is missing in ART centres and drug supply is also not on time."

He said final touches were being given to the “comprehensive and radical Bill on HIV/AIDS” that has been drafted with an aim to fight discrimination against people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. The Bill was drafted and finalised in 2006 by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare after countrywide consultations with stakeholders, and sent to the Law Ministry. Delay in tabling of the Bill had led to protests by activists.,Speaking about the book, originally written in the Malayalam, Mr. Moily said that more such books that speak openly and boldly against oppression of many kinds should be published in Kannada. People should watch out for the Stockholm Syndrome whereby they get used to oppression, he said. “A silent society is the worst society,” he added. The book, he said, speaks “beyond the written word” and with courage, going beyond the binaries of moral-immoral and right and wrong. Conservative attitudes, he said, were defeating many of good legislations. The book should not be judged by the old hackneyed tools of criticism but with a fresh and open perspective."

,In order to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the Prevention of Parent-to-Child Transmission Programme was being implemented in all government medical college and district headquarters hospitals and also Primary Health Centres.,From January last year, 16,058 women underwent voluntary HIV testing at 26 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres. Of them 40 were found to be HIV positive and brought under the Prevention of Parent-to-Child Transmission Programme.,As on February 2009, around 3,125 persons living with HIV had been provided free Anti Retro Viral Therapy that helped to increase the life span and the quality of life.,Dr. Doraikannan urged the media to work for the creation of an atmosphere where HIV positive persons and other vulnerable groups such as sex workers and transgenders were treated with dignity.,Joint Director of TANSACS Alex Parimalam said the State had 1.84 lakh people living with HIV, as per the estimates in 2007.,It was a role model for the rest of the country in terms of projects for prevention of HIV and also treatment and care.,But, there a need to fight the stigma that prevented HIV-affected people from availing of the support services for rehabilitation.,A woman living with HIV said at the meeting that stigma was the main impediment to availing of these services.,Appreciating the media’s contribution so far in highlighting such services, she said it should continue so that persons with HIV could break out of the shackles imposed by the stigma and benefit from the programmes introduced for them."

,Bangalore: The health scenario in the State is likely to go in for a toss in the next 15 days. While government doctors, who have been demanding pay parity, incentives and time-bound promotions, are determined to resign en masse on September 29 as their demands have not been met, the 650 HIV/AIDS counsellors working for the Government are also planning to strike work from October 5 pressing for higher wages.,All the 4,199 government doctors, including the Director (Health and Family Welfare Services) and joint directors, will submit their letters to the Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) I.R. Perumal on Monday.,“Although we will give 15 days for the Government to accept our resignations, we will be grateful if it relieves us on the first day itself. We will set up private clinics outside the hospitals where we are working and ensure that patients are not put to hardship,” H.N. Ravindra, president of Karnataka Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) said.,He explained that the package announced after the Cabinet meet on Friday was just eyewash. “They have shown a house rent allowance of Rs. 2,810 for general duty medical officers. But only 500 of the 2,586 officers who are posted in urban areas are eligible for this. The rest working in rural areas will continue to get Rs. 700. This is an example of how the Government is hoodwinking us,” Dr. Ravindra said.,“The Government has fooled us by offering a marginal hike. We do not wish to continue working as bonded labourers,” he added.,Meanwhile, members of the Karnataka State HIV/AIDS Counsellor’s Association, who have been demanding regularisation of their services and higher wages, have threatened to strike work from October 5.,“We will not send the monthly report for September to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Although NACO had five months ago directed the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) to double our salaries from Rs. 6,500, nothing has been done so far. Besides, KSAPS has threatened to terminate our services if we go ahead with the strike,” Fayaz Ahmed, association secretary told The Hindu on Saturday. Though these counsellors were appointed on the basis of postgraduate employees’ wage scale, they are paid Rs. 6,500.,“We have been working for this amount for the last eight years. While most people want to stay away from HIV/AIDS infected people, our work is in association with them. Our main role is to prevent the spread and transmission of the dreaded disease from parent to child. Yet, we are paid much less than what graduate clerks are paid in other health offices,” Mr Ahmed pointed out."

While 30 per cent of the patients will be helped without levying any charges, the others will be provided treatment at Rs.400 per session, Georgi Abraham, TANKER’s founder trustee said.,The function was held at Madras Medical Mission Hospital in Mogappair. The HIV Dialysis Unit will be located at 766 Poonamalle High Road, Kilpauk, according to Latha Kumaraswami, managing trustee, TANKER Foundation.,It is estimated that 17 per cent of persons infected with HIV have chronic kidney disease. The HIV infection itself is a cause for renal disease, Dr. Abraham said. Even in cases where people can afford the treatment, many hospitals turn patients away because they are HIV positive. “All you have to do is to follow universally recommended hygiene and sanitation protocols in the normal course of treating patients,” he added.,Positive people have the right to care and treatment, too and to help these patients TANKER Foundation decided to set up a special unit for them. Mr. Ravi said the new venture will help poor people, who have already been isolated because of stigma and discrimination. HIV positive people should feel wanted and TANKER’s new scheme would ensure that, he added. He later released a book on Nephrology authored by Dr. Abraham.,Suniti Solomon, Director, YRG Care, complimented TANKER for setting up the special unit, which would be of immense help to poor patients.,Dilip Mathai of Christian Medical College, Vellore, said a lot had to be done in terms of providing health care to positive people, even performing transplantation surgeries."

,ANCHETTY (KRISHNAGIRI): A kattai panchayat in Sesurajapuram village in Krishnagiri district assumed “extra constitutional powers” and fined a woman recently. Her supposed sin: she is HIV infected.,Santhana Mary, whose husband, a victim of the dreaded disease, died one-and-a-half years ago, lives with her aged parents in the village with two daughters (fortunately not infected by the disease).,Mary ekes out a living by selling milk. Some youth, including a certain David, are alleged to have abused her on August 21. A distraught Mary told her parents about the incident and also her four brothers working as weavers in Erode.,When Mary’s mother Anthony Ammal went to David’s house to enquire about it she was said to have been beaten up and kicked by David and his father Arokyam. Her brothers – Ravi, Charles, Gnanaprakasam and Yesu – came to the village the same night. They went to David’s house to protest against the ill-treatment meted out to their mother and sister.,On August 22 some villagers went to Mary’s house and took her brothers, aged parents and a neighbour Periyasamy to the Anchetti police station alleging that they had damaged David’s house.,With the help of the police, village elders led by Marya Prakasam, a postman in Sesurajapuram village, reportedly conducted a kattai panchayat outside the police station and fined the family Rs. 30,000 for damaging David’s house. Mary’s brothers pleaded before the panchayat that they could pay only Rs. 15,000 and that they needed at least two weeks to pay the amount.,Mary, her brothers and parents were, however, detained by the police. A head constable on duty is alleged to have collected Rs. 2,000 from them to release them. A mediator (between the villagers and Mary’s family) Sandhiyahoo is said to have taken another Rs. 3,000 for food to the villagers who had come to the station.,Mary’s brothers came to the village from Erode on Sept. 12 with Rs. 15,000. Not content with this, Mr. Sandhiyahoo forcibly took a motor cycle belonging to Mr. Periyasamy, who had gone with the brothers, in lieu of the balance amount of Rs. 15,000. The vehicle was then handed over to the villagers who took the fine amount but refused to return the vehicle.,This was the last straw for Mary and her family. They petitioned the District Collector at the weekly grievances day meeting in Krishnagiri on Sept. 14.,The Collector, V.K.Shanmugham, directed the Superintendent of Police, A.G. Babu, to take appropriate action. Mr. Babu reprimanded the policeman who took Rs. 2000 and directed Sub-Inspector R. Manickam to retrieve the motor cycle and Rs. 15,000 from the villagers to return to Mary’s family.,Mr. Manickam got the vehicle back but is alleged to have asked Mary and her family members to give a written statement that David and her family had previous enmity. They, however, refused to give such a statement.,Mr. Manickam let the villagers off on Tuesday (Sept. 15) evening, but detained Mary and her family members, including the aged parents, till 11 p.m.,It was only at the intervention of Mr. Kumar, president, Krishnagiri District Living with HIV AIDS Welfare Society, that Mr. Manickam released them, after getting an assurance that they would come to the police station on Wednesday (Sept. 16) morning.,The vehicle is still with the police and Mary has not got back the Rs. 15,000 she had paid as fine. Mr. Manickam evaded a query as to whether any action had been initiated against the kattai panchayat but said he had registered first information reports against both the parties.,The police on Wednesday arrested Mary’s father Kannupaiyan and brothers Gnanaprakasam and Ravi and villagers Kuppu, Thammayan, Francis, Sesu alias Sesurajan and Arokyaraj. They were produced before the court in Denkanikottai which remanded them to judicial custody."

HIV entry ban repealed
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/HIV-entry-ban-repealed/article16485944.ece,"By announcing the end of a 22-year-old ban on the entry of people with HIV into the United States, President Barack Obama has once again shown that scientific considerations alone would shape decisions concerning science. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has followed up promptly, by publishing the rule in the Federal Register. The U.S. was one of a dozen countries that have archaic laws barring the entry of people infected by HIV. Although President George Bush amended the Immigration and Nationality Act last year, the HHS did not remove it from the list of communicable diseases. The ban in the U.S. was enacted in 1987 amidst widespread fears that HIV, like tuberculosis, was a communicable disease and spread through physical or respiratory contact. Accordingly, HIV infection was enlisted as a “communicable disease of public health significance” and the entry of visitors and immigrants with the infection banned. Despite the aetiology and routes of transmission of HIV becoming clearer over the last two decades, and UNAIDS and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) concluding, in 2004, that “HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions have no public health justification,” the irrational bar remained.,In fact, the illiberal law has not served the purpose of containing the spread of a virus that has become endemic in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the virus has infected about one million people. The entry ban has also ended up creating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and this in turn has kept people away from getting tested. According to the CDC, about one in five are not aware of their infection status and are responsible for 50-70 per cent of all new sexually transmitted infection cases. The fear of discrimination is one reason why the CDC 2006 recommendation that everyone between 13 years and 64 years should be routinely tested for the infection in medical encounters has not been heeded. An offshoot of the ban is that no international HIV/AIDS scientific conference has been held in the U.S. for the past 20 years. All this is likely to change. The U.S., which has played a pivotal role in fighting the war against the virus in Africa, can now set its house in order. Nearly half a dozen sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea have been wrongly classified as communicable diseases of public health significance. The CDC may remove them from its list in due course after a scientific review."

A similar opinion is expressed by the prison medical officer too,” the Superintendent said.,A Division Bench comprising Justice Chitra Venkataraman and Justice M.

Stating that steps were being taken to ease the congestion, he denied allegations that overcrowding had lead to inhumane treatment of the inmates.,As on August 21, 2009, a total of 1,528 prisoners (including 797 convicts, 662 remand prisoners and those facing trials and 69 persons detained under the Goondas Act) were lodged in the prison as against the authorised capacity of 1,252 inmates.,“Though the Madurai Central Prison is overcrowded, the condition in the prison is not inhuman and the prisoners are provided with all basic amenities like food, shelter, water, clothes, medical treatment and recreational facilities,” the official said.,He pointed out that two sub-jails in Dindigul and Virudhunagar had been upgraded as district jails recently thereby reducing new admissions in the Madurai prison. A sub-jail in Ramanthapuram district would also be upgraded soon. The Superintendent further said, “prisoners who are found to be mentally ill are being separated from other prisoners and guarded properly. They are not allowed to mingle with other healthy prisoners.”,He also said that the Principal District Judge, the Chief Judicial Magistrate and the Joint Director of Health Services who visited the prison on several occasions between July 12, 2008 and March 21 this year had recorded their satisfaction over the facilities available."

The rest are provided with nutrition enhancement tablets, according to informed sources.,Obviously, the high number of number of HIV/AIDS infected persons in the district is viewed by the medical fraternity as a cause for extreme concern, but the rise in the number of patients over the years is also attributed to the sensitisation programmes. The affected people are learning to live with the reality. As many as 2,000 among those who receive ART are members of the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS. The Network that has been reaching out to affected people to sensitise them through peer educators to the avenues for treatment through Global Fund Round 4 Access to Care and Treatment (ACT) Project is keen on taking the awareness exercise to the doorsteps of the ignorant people.,It organises periodic conventions for the 110 peer educators it has trained so far to enlist more members in the Network. According to M. Vijayalakshmi, president of Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS, middle class people have begun to shed their diffidence and are turning up to the ART centres. The Network has, however, been only partially successful in extending the sensitisation exercise to the identified patients belonging to higher economic or social strata. This section apparently prefers private treatment. The therapy when availed at private clinics costs at least Rs. 2,000 per patient a month.,At a recent peer educator convention organised by the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS, the participants were honoured for their services and motivated to carry on with their work on a voluntary basis. The event served as a forum for them to share their experiences and accomplishments and to devise strategies to further firm up the network at the grass roots.,According to Ms. Vijayalaksmi, the educational activities being organised for the peer educators have developed their knowledge and attitudes. They have been imparted with the skill training for remaining healthy and simultaneously carry out the sensitisation tasks for protecting the health of other HIV affected people they come across or go after."

Even though millions of people are infected with HIV every year globally, only a fraction of those who require anti-retroviral therapy actually receive it. Various kinds of discrimination prevent many in this group from accessing the available HIV-care services. Protection of human rights is thus vital for combating the HIV epidemic is the message conveyed on the day.,All programmes will be organised jointly by the various service centres of the KSACS and other voluntary organisations in the field.,The red ribbon is an international symbol of AIDS awareness, representing the global fight against HIV/AIDS. People are encouraged to wear the red ribbon on World AIDS Day as a symbol of their solidarity in the fight against the epidemic and to demonstrate their care and concern for those affected by the infection. Volunteers will pin the red ribbon on Chief Minister V. S. Achuthanandan at his official residence on Tuesday morning as part of the campaign.,All government officials at the Collectorate, Social Welfare Department, Corporation, municipalities, district medical offices, etc., will wear red ribbons on the day.

,
,The workshop also dealt with media ethics that have been evolved in response to past reportage of HIV-affected persons and the issues that arose as a result.,Citing examples of disclosure of identities of PWHRA which have caused them stigma and social exclusion, it was suggested that the mediapersons use actual names only with the “informed consent” of these persons. They should also be cautious while interviewing HIV-infected children who may not fully understand their precarious situation. The resource persons at the workshop said another problem area in journalism was the use of inappropriate language and jargon that inadvertently or otherwise biased readers and viewers against HIV-affected persons.,The fuelling of stereotypes, resorting to sensationalism and the lack of objectivity and gender neutrality had haunted some of the past media reports, they said."

The disease had become an obstacle in the nation’s development and it was the most critical problem dogging our society, they said. The disease could be prevented with discipline and sanity in life.,Zilla Parishad Chairperson T. Kavitha stated that it was the responsibility of the society to create awareness among those who contracted AIDS to take treatment to extend their lifeline. Of the about 5.4 lakh HIV positives in the State only 54,000 were taking treatment, she said.,The HIV positives were facing glaring discrimination, particularly in their neighbourhoods, among their relatives, offices and schools, she noted. “We all must not forget that by discriminating against them socially we are cutting short their lifespan as lack of moral support will make them lose confidence to fight the disease,” the ZP Chairperson noted.,Government Whip S. Sailajanath, who is also convenor of State HIV/AIDS Legislature Forum, said there were about 6,000 AIDS patients in the district and vowed to take up with the government to extend social security pension scheme to HIV positives.,The Asha-I and Asha-II programmes from 2005 had helped create awareness on HIV/AIDS among people by alleviating misconceptionsA total of about 1,700 HIV positives attended the meet.

,CHENNAI: While persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) unanimously agree that the situation in Tamil Nadu has improved in the last five years and the hard-nosed advocacy to ensure that they are not discriminated against has helped, life is far from normal.,PLHAs still face trouble in getting a rental accommodation, medical treatment and are the first to be laid off. They end up paying twice or three times more for medical treatment as they do not want to be denied access to healthcare.,“The moment I declare my condition, in a government hospital they will give me a bed in the corner of the room or near the bathroom. In private hospitals they will say we don’t have facility or ask us to pay twice or three times more for a procedure,” says P. Kousalya President, Positive Women Network (PWN+).,She recalls that a computer professional was asked to return to his home country after the organisation he was working for in the city learnt of his status.,When it comes to providing pension to the widowed, officials expedite the process if a widow declares herself positive, Ms. Kousalya says.,In such cases, a woman would receive her pension within three months. A PLHA certificate ensures that government pension is settled quickly, says Ms. Kousalya, who declared herself a widow to prevent delays.,Recalling an incident at the Government Hospital in Chengalpet a fortnight ago where a woman was thrown out of the hospital after she was found to be positive, K.K. Abraham, president of Indian Network for People living with HIV/AIDS, says, “Disclosure of status is not easy as there is fear of discrimination. In rural areas discrimination is more.” A volunteer at Government Kilpauk Hospital admits that the behaviour of the hospital staff differs when they learn of the patient’s positive status.,
,
,“Neglect of women who come for pregnancy or abortion is very common,” says Sujatha Natarajan, President of Family Planning Association of India, which works with PLHA.,In the last six months her organisation provided abortion services to three pregnant women in Chennai who were denied treatment by private hospitals.,“Excuses abound. All this happens in the name of caution. With all the sensitisation which we are doing for others discrimination comes from the medical fraternity. The situation is worse for unmarried women, a transgender or commercial sex workers. Non-judgemental approach to the issue has not happened.,S. Manimegalai, a PLHA working in Villupuram district, says disclosure will happen when the house owner gets curious about the frequent hospital visits.,“So long as our health is good and we look good, no doubts arise but once the status is known we are asked to vacate the house,” she says.,There have also been instances where a person was laid off on the pretext that the company had moved to a far-off place.,YRG Care will soon inaugurate a special surgical unit for PLHA on its campus and a special unit for dialysis for positive people was started only last week in the city by TANKER Foundation."

While 30 per cent of the patients will be helped at no charge, the others will be provided treatment at Rs.400 per session, Georgi Abraham, TANKER’s founder trustee said.,The function was held at Madras Medical Mission Hospital in Mogappair. The HIV Dialysis Unit will be located at 766, Poonamalle High Road, Kilpauk, according to Latha Kumaraswami, managing trustee, TANKER Foundation. It is estimated that 17 per cent of persons infected with HIV have chronic kidney disease.,The HIV infection itself is a cause for renal disease, Dr.Abraham said.,Even in cases where people can afford the treatment, many hospitals turn patients away because they are HIV positive. “All you have to do is to follow universally recommended hygiene and sanitation protocols in the normal course of treating patients,” he added. .,
,
,Mr. Ravi said the new venture will help poor people, who have already been isolated because of stigma and discrimination. HIV positive people should feel wanted and TANKER’s new scheme would ensure that, he added.,He later released a book on Nephrology authored by Dr. Abraham."

HIV risk perception among students has come down: Subburaj
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/HIV-risk-perception-among-students-has-come-down-Subburaj/article16483094.ece,"Special Correspondent,CHENNAI: While it was encouraging to note increasing levels of condom use across all high risk groups, it was a cause for concern that HIV risk perception among students had come down, Principal Secretary, Health, V.K.Subburaj, said.,Commenting on the results of the Behaviour Surveillance Survey (BSS) carried out by AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) Project in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, Mr. Subburaj said that it was unacceptable for risk perception to fall, especially among youngsters, both girls and boys. “Despite years of information communication, we have not managed to get through to some groups and discrimination and stigma still continue. So we have to modify our information and communication strategies years,” he added.,Clearly there is a need to step up activities of the Red Ribbon Clubs, started in educational institutions to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS, he suggested. However, if all agencies focussing on their allocated tasks properly, then it was possible to reach a stage of zero new infections, Mr.Subburaj said.,Earlier, he released a monograph on the results of the 12th wave of the BSS in Tamil Nadu and the seventh survey in Puducherry since 2001. The survey was conducted across 13 different population groups in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Theni, Salem, Vellore, Erode, Nagercoil, Dindigul, Palani, Tiruchirapalli and Tuticorin. In Pondicherry, the survey covered Puducherry and Karaikal districts. Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Tiruchi, Karur, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin were covered as Intensive Intervention Districts of APAC.,The population groups were female sex workers, truckers and helpers, male youth in slums, factory workers, migrant workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, transgenders, male patients at STD Clinics, Students and for the first time, People Living with HIV were included.,The key results indicated that there were both positives and negatives, Bimal Charles, director, APAC, said. Knowledge on at least two correct methods of preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV was close to 100 percent among all population groups except among female factory and migrant workers. Again, respondents almost universally reported that consistent condom usage prevents HIV, but more efforts are required to counter myths and misconceptions in intervention programs to spread awareness of STI and HIV.,As far as condom use goes, while it is high with paid partners, usage with non-paid or regular partners is comparatively lower. Needle sharing behaviour among IDUs has been showing a declining trend across all the waves and in the current wave, around 43.0 per cent reported such behaviour.,The incidence of STI is low in all categories and the treatment-seeking-behaviour from a qualified health practitioner continued to be very high, with a majority approaching a government STD clinic for the treatment.,There has been an increase in testing practices among all groups except migrant workers, factory workers and youth in slums. This is mainly due to the fact that risk perception among them is low, APAC officials pointed out.,S.Vijayakumar, project director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, said the key now is to use the lessons of the BSS to translate interventions into action.,Also indicating that a “zero-infection” rate was within the realm of achievement in the State, he urged all partners to ensure that healthcare is provided comprehensively and cost effectively to all those who need it.,E.S.Krishnamoorthy, honorary secretary, Voluntary Health Services, said the studying behaviour is important as it helps to plan for the future, prevent further infections, and stem the tide of the epidemic, at least in this instance. There are many lessons from the data of the BSS that could change the way policy is drawn up in future, he added."

,Bangalore: Karnataka is one of the States in India with a high HIV prevalence, with an estimated 2.75 lakh people currently living with the virus. But there is heartening news on the eve of World AIDS Day: targeted prevention interventions have played a significant role in controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact.,
,
,A mathematical modelling projection based on studies done in two districts by the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), established by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and University of Manitoba (UM), shows that the situation would have been far worse but for the interventions that have been scaled up effectively since 2003.,HIV sentinel surveillance among ante-natal clinic (ANC) populations in 27 districts over the years shows that the HIV prevalence has come down from 1.6 per cent in 2003 to 0.86 in 2007-08.,In sheer numbers, this reduction in prevalence would reduce the number of HIV-positive newborns by over 2,000 every year. “This is much greater than the most optimistic estimates from Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) programmes,” says Dr. Stephen Moses, Project Director of the Sankalp/Corridors Project (Avahan India-AIDS initiative) implemented by the KHPT. Karnataka is the only State to have a government Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre in every district.,Statistics show that Karnataka has been able to maintain high levels of treatment adherence. “As a result of good coordination at the district level, our ‘lost to follow up’ among patients on ART is about 3.2 per cent, while the national average is around 7 per cent,” says Dr. Reynold Washington, in-charge Project Director of the Samastha-USAID project in Karnataka.,However, a particular point of concern is the situation in north Karnataka districts, with high levels of HIV-TB co-infection. Districts in the region also show a higher HIV prevalence among the rural population.,The prevalence of HIV in Bagalkot is 2.38 per cent in urban population and 3.59 per cent in rural areas (2003). In contrast, in Mysore, it is 0.94 per cent (urban) and 0.71 per cent (rural)."

,
,The government issued this order on the basis of a recommendation from the Kerala State AIDS Control Society, which pointed out that a majority of HIV-positive persons had no income of their own, which made it unaffordable for them to get done many medical tests which might be required as part of the ART.,According to official estimate, there are 55,167 HIV-positive persons in the State. However, only 10,491 persons have registered at the Ushus centres.,Only those who have registered their names at the Ushus centres will be eligible for the medical and travel concessions that the government has been offering HIV-positive persons.,

Ilangovan,SALEM: In their gloomy lives of despair, it has rung in the peels of hope. The ringing sound and the clatter of voices near a phone have turned out to be the most suitable livelihood support for those living and suffering silently in the remote villages and hamlets in Salem district.,For those living with the infection, the monthly earning through the `One rupee’ Public Telephone Coin Box has not only kept their hearth burning but also enabled them to lead a quality life.,
,
,This transformation is made possible through a collaborative venture of the Department of Health, Private telecom firms and Project Concern International (PCI), an NGO working among the people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHAs) here.,The novel concept, first of its kind in the country, was launched in 2007 as a `pilot project’ without fanfare.,Twenty coin phone boxes were fixed at a few Primary Health Centres (PHC) in the district and in places where the public congregate. Recently five more have been added.,The project is based on `ownership’ concept wherein the beneficiary will have to pay Rs. 1500 as deposit to get a cost effective coin box. PCI’s S. Ramkumar says that Tata Telecom has offered them Rs. 500 as free talk time as initial incentive.,After assessing its success, Reliance has also come forward to enhance the profit margin and AirTel, another service provider, has expressed its wish to join them.,The project, according to a recent study, has thrown some healthy tales of survival. Says HIV affected Suresh (name changed), the only male beneficiary who runs a coin phone box at his village’s PHC, “The revenue through the Re.1 coin box ensures me a monthly income of Rs. 500 to Rs. 800.,It enables me to supplement my diet with nutritional inputs, which are quite essential for a quality life.” His claims are endorsed by other beneficiaries, all women, who eke out a livelihood from these coin phone boxes in many villages and in urban pockets. They say that though they are on free ART, the revenue from these coin boxes helps them meet the expenses they incur on the nutrition-rich food.,The study further says that 16 coin boxes, run by PLHAs, have erased the discrimination too. Among them are 19 women and of whom 14 are widows.Even after two years, 80 per cent of the boxes are ringing in a steady flow of money thus holding out a glimmer of hope to the victims.,`Salem Success’ has spurred the motivators to expand the project at national level."

Subburaj launched the helpline and made the first call on 1800-419-1800 posing a question from a real incident of discrimination to the counsellor. Speaking as a representative of a Chennai college, he said a couple of staff at the engineering college had been detected to be HIV positive. Students of the college were exercised by this and demanded that the cooks be dismissed from service.,The counsellor advised him not to sack the staff and instead to provide counselling to the college management and the students, assuring them that transmission of the virus through non-sexual routes was literally non existent.,Mr. Subburaj, speaking later, said the counsellor had provided satisfactory responses and he was sure that the helpline would be of benefit to PLHA and others with co-infections such as Tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.,Hello+ would address a long-felt need in the state’s HIV/AIDS control programme that had otherwise done very well in the areas of prevention and care and support, he said. It was absolutely crucial for positive people to be able to talk to others about their problems and seek help from professionals. Being able to voice their problems would bring down the burden substantially, Mr. Subburaj added. He suggested that some psychiatrists also be roped into the project.,
,
,Hello +, conceived and implemented as a public-private partnership between the USAID funded Aids Prevention and Control Project at VHS and Tata Business Support Services and Tata Teleservices, will also see the involvement of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society and networks of PLHA and NGOs.,Bimal Charles, project director, APAC, said while at present the helpline would be operational in Tamil Nadu, the Andhra Pradesh government had also expressed a willingness to join the programme. Eventually the facility would be available in all languages. Even today, people from all over the country can contact the number for information, but will receive information only in Tamil, Telugu, English and Hindi. He thanked the Tata group for providing free software and subsidising fifty per cent of the STD call charges.,S. Vijay Kumar, project director, TANSACS, said networks of positive people should encourage their members to register for anti-retro virals. A total of 50 link ART centres are coming up in the state in order to facilitate more PLHA to get treatment. Next year, 40 more such link centres would come up. He commended APAC and its partners for setting up a service that would be of help to all PLHA and those hesitating to test themselves for HIV.,Kerry Pelzman, Director, Public Health and Nutrition, USAID, released the information, education and communication material for using the helpline and handed over the first copy to a representative of positive networks. She said USAID began supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and control activity in Tamil Nadu in 1992. Touting the helpline as an important milestone in public private partnership in the battle against HIV/AIDS, she added that no government could tackle the epidemic by itself."

Subburaj launched the helpline and made the first call on 1800-419-1800 posing a question from a real incident of discrimination to the counsellor.,Speaking as a representative of a Chennai college, he said a couple of staff at the engineering college had been found to be HIV +. Students of the college were exercised by this and demanded that the cooks be dismissed from service. The counsellor advised him not to sack the staff and instead to provide counselling to the college management and the students, assuring them that transmission of the virus through non-sexual routes was literally non-existent.,Mr. Subburaj, speaking later, said the counsellor had provided satisfactory responses and he was sure that the helpline would benefit PLHA and others with co-infections such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.,
,
,Hello+ would address a long-felt need in the state’s HIV/AIDS control programme that had otherwise done very well in the areas of prevention and care and support, he said.,It was absolutely crucial for positive people to be able to talk to others about their problems and seek help from professionals. Being able to voice their problems would bring down the burden substantially. He suggested that some psychiatrists be roped into the project.,Hello +, conceived and implemented as a public private partnership between the USAID funded Aids Prevention and Control Project at VHS and Tata Business Support Services and Tata Teleservices, will also see the involvement of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society and networks of PLHA and NGOs.,Bimal Charles, project director, APAC, said while at present the helpline would be operational in Tamil Nadu, the Andhra Pradesh government had also expressed a willingness to join the programme. Eventually, the facility would be available in all languages. Even today, people from all over the country could contact the number for information, but would receive information only in Tamil, Telugu, English and Hindi. He thanked the Tata group for providing free software and subsidising fifty per cent of the STD call charges.,S.Vijay Kumar, project director, TANSACS, said networks of positive people should encourage their members to register for anti-retro virals.,A total of 50 link ART centres were coming up in the State to help more PLHA to get treatment. Next year, 40 more such link centres would come up. He commended APAC and its partners for setting up a service that would be of help to all PLHA and those hesitating to test themselves for HIV.,Kerry Pelzman, Director, Public Health and Nutrition, USAID, released the information, education and communication material for using the helpline and handed over the first copy to a representative of positive networks. She said USAID began supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and control activity in Tamil Nadu in 1992.,Touting the helpline as an important milestone in public private partnership in the battle against HIV/AIDS, she added that no government could tackle the epidemic by itself."

,HYDERABAD: A research team of the University of Texas is close to finding a “very good candidate” for developing a vaccine for the Human Immuno Virus (HIV) that causes the Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). “The time has come for translation of basic science to clinic,” said Sudhir Paul, director of the Clinical Immunology Research Centre of the University of Texas.,Professor Paul said their approach was innovative in that the emphasis was on prevention through a region in the virus that is “quite constant” and useful for binding it to the cell. The team focussed on the covalent approach instead of the non-covalent approach on which the existing vaccines are based, to break the tolerance of the virus. The method was adopted to see whether the covalent vaccine, containing chemical extract, not only bound with the cell effectively but also ensured generation of more and more antibodies to prevent the spread of the virus. The approach was necessitated by the rapid mutation of the HIV virus, he said.,“Experiments have shown that we can break the tolerance and induce cells to produce more antibodies that are broadly reactive to diverse strains so that the infection by all strains of the virus could be stopped,” Professor Paul told The Hindu.,The process involved development of abzymes (from antibody and enzyme), which are monoclonal antibodies with catalytic activity for permanently breaking thousands of virus molecules, unlike the regular antibody that could be targeted at a single molecule, he said.,As the experiments have met with success, efforts were on to take the candidate for testing in human beings, preferably on those who were infected and those who were resistant to current drugs. “Development of covalent vaccine is a completely new approach, and the process of developing the vaccine should not take more than a year, provided we have enough money and community support,” he said.,He admitted that there would be a lot of resistance from the scientific establishment, but it was because science looked for proof."

,CHENNAI: A day-long workshop stressing the need for insurance cover for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was conducted by the Genesis Welfare Trust recently.,Representatives of various organisations working in the field, networks of people with HIV and representatives from the insurance industry participated.,Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control (APAC) project, said, “There are certain issues surrounding HIV for which finding an answer is extremely difficult. Insurance is one such issue.”,The current system of insurance cover is a system of exclusion, according to Mr. Charles. “You get an insurance cover only when you can prove that you have no immediate need for it,” he added.,According to a recent study conducted by the APAC, 94 per cent of HIV patients sought private care and were willing to pay a monthly premium towards insurance.,
,
,K. Radhakrishnan, president of the Kancheepuram Network for HIV positive people, said, “I am living with HIV and there are many of us who are leading a normal life like anybody else. We are not asking for any special concessions. We just feel it is our basic human right to get ourselves insured.”,“They should be treated like any other citizen. Insurance companies in the U.S. and Europe have come forward with schemes to insure those living with HIV. But it is still a challenge for HIV positive people to have a life insurance cover in India,” said R. Thangathurai of the Genesis Welfare Trust.,
,
,According to recent estimates, there are over 23 lakh people living with HIV in India, of which 2.47 lakh are in Tamil Nadu.,NACO figures show that over 1.7 lakh people are currently benefiting from the ART treatment.,The programme has proved successful in extending the lifespan of people living with HIV.,“We are not beggars. We don’t want anything for free. Treat us like normal human beings by removing societal stigma and occupational discrimination. We too can pay any amount of premium,” said Mr. Radhakrishnan."

However, there was a “magic bullet” for treating HIV; which had enzymatic capabilities as well. Reminding the students and doctors at Katuri, he said that - HAART, and other T-cell vaccinations had failed. In some patients, HIV had developed a resistance to HAART treatment. Cytotoxic t-cells were not useful, as they could not keep up with all of the HIV mutations.,Suggesting the best possible vaccination he said currently Synthetic Peptide, activated with an electrophile, known as E-VAC could break down the CD4 binding site of the HIV virus protein. Antibodies were catalytic, in the sense that catalysts were a single antibody that catalyze the breakdown of multiple HIV proteins per minute. The halflife of antibody was approximately equivalent to 20 days, he explained.,Professor Sudhir Paul and Professor Yauhiro Nishiyama had engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the gp 120 / CD4 binding site. The superantigenic region was the region of HIV that does not change, if it does change, then the HIV cannot bind to the CD4 region. Further explaining his work he said that once the abzyme has cut the HIV molecule, IgM, IgG, IgA (all naturally occurring antibodies) can further target the HIV molecules and destroy them.,He looked at genetically different strains of HIV. Viruses taken from different strains of the HIV virus were infected into human cells in the presence of the Lupus HIV-CAB. All of the viruses were seen to be neutralized."

Of them, 332 tested positive. Similarly, of the 1069 TB patients tested for HIV, 120 have been found positive for HIV.

Whether government or private, every school must be obligated to admit children living with HIV/AIDS.,A roundtable held here on Thursday called for mounting a unified response to safeguard the right of the affected children, particularly in the light of their open stigmatisation and denial of right to schooling. The roundtable was jointly held by the Centre for Advocacy and Research, Freedom Foundation, M.V.

,CHENNAI: Following a petition stating that the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) had used the photographs of a woman and an infant in its banners without their consent, the Madras High Court on Wednesday directed it to remove them within a week.,The woman, who stated that she was not HIV-infected, claimed she had taken her child a couple of years ago for polio vaccination when the photographs were taken. They were being used in AIDS awareness banners, subjecting her and her family to humiliation. She sent a representation to TANSACS in June but had not received a reply.,In its reply, TANSACS said that a private advertising agency had designed the banners and hoardings for the awareness programme. The Society did not use photographs or material relating to people living with HIV/AIDS without their permission. It was not liable in this case as the photograph was obtained through the advertising agency. It was “convinced that agencies make use of photographs only with the consent of the individual.”,Claiming that the photographs were owned by Joel Doussat who had published them on the website ,, counsel for TANSACS said “… the petitioners, after allowing the photographs to go public on the website, that too for commercial purposes, cannot now make a hue and cry [that they were published without their consent].”,Denying that it had “interfered with the fundamental rights of the petitioner … just for our publicity,” TANSACS said it was ready to remove the photographs if the court directed it to.,Observing orally that it was a “serious matter,” and that it had affected the family’s social standing, Justice K. Suguna directed TANSACS to remove the pictures and permitted the petitioner to implead the private advertising agency in the petition. She posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks."

,KOLKATA: West Bengal is one of the five States which have managed to control tuberculosis well. But in the past five years, the programme has stagnated. This trend can be changed with the participation of civil society, Director of Health Services Aniruddha Kar said on Thursday.,Dr. Kar highlighted three important issues in the government programme — tackling the growing incidence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), better coordination between the National AIDS Control Programme and the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) and creating awareness among various communities of the disease.,He was inaugurating a regional consultative meeting here of the partners of the Partnership for Tuberculosis Care and Control in India.,The Partnership for Tuberculosis Care and Control is a forum for NGOs working in the field to support the national programme, said Subrat Mohanty, technical officer of the United States Agency for International Development’s World Vision Project. In January this year, a secretariat was appointed to provide technical and administrative support to member-NGOs, he said.,On the first day of the meeting, issues of the NGOs working in the eastern States were raised. It was also an occasion for Health Department officials and international NGOs to share their experiences in the fight against tuberculosis.,
,
,“Three per cent of tuberculosis cases are MDRTB,” said Dr. Kar. The percentage was higher among cases where the disease was contracted a second time. Enough information should be made available to patients to curb the incidence of MDRTB, he said.,For MDRTB, treatment was as long as two years and the cost was 8-10 times higher, said Kerry Pelzman from the USAID.,“Since tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among HIV infected people, there is need to coordinate the two programmes,” said Dr. Sanjay Kapoor from the USAID. When a person got in touch with the HIV control programme, he must immediately be referred to the DOTS programme, he said.,Family Health International (FHI) which, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started the Avahan initiative to address HIV-related issues, included a tuberculosis awareness programme in six high prevalence States.,“We have been able to reach 2,50,000 people from marginalised communities who would normally not have access to tuberculosis detection or the DOTS programme through peer education,” said Dr. Bitra George, FHI country director."

,Hyderabad: Religion, according to Napoleon Bonaparte, might be an excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet. But the health authorities see in it a brilliant ploy to keep the HIV/AIDS at bay.,Alarmed at the growing incidence of the ailment, it is proposed to rope in the clergy to address the issue. Since they wield enormous influence over the people, they are considered the best bet to tackle the disease. The A.P. State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) feels a word from the religious scholars will carry greater weight since they command immense respect from the masses because of their ability to interpret the holy scriptures.,To start with, the services of ulemas and imams of the mosques are being requisitioned to create awareness about HIV/AIDS in the Muslim community. As a pilot project, the APSACS plans to sensitise the Muslim priests in Hyderabad, Warangal, Kurnool and Anantapur districts.,For this, the Confederation of Voluntary Associations (COVA), a noted NGO, is identified to train the ulemas by giving them the necessary inputs about HIV/AIDS. “They have the potential to influence the behaviour and thinking of people like nothing else,” says R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, APSACS.,A large number of the marginalised section of Muslim community is falling prey to HIV/AIDS.,Especially those working as truck drivers and semi-skilled labourers are in danger of coming under the high risk group. And their lack of awareness about the HIV scenario is only making matters worse.,“We are not able to effectively communicate with them. So we thought the religious leaders can fill this gap,” says Mr. Chandravadan.,A one-day central orientation workshop will be held at Hyderabad for the religious leaders of each district.,They in turn will orient the madarasa teachers in their respective areas. Besides awareness, meetings in 20 madarasas in each district will be held. Religious congregations like urs, ijtemas, Id and the Friday sermons will also be used to convey the threat posed by the HIV/AIDS."

New HIV strain discovered in a woman from Cameroon
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/New-HIV-strain-discovered-in-a-woman-from-Cameroon/article15951531.ece,"A new strain of the virus that causes AIDS has been discovered in a woman from the African nation of Cameroon.,It differs from the three known strains of human immunodeficiency virus and appears to be closely related to a form of simian virus recently discovered in wild gorillas, researchers report in Monday’s edition of the journal Nature Medicine.,The finding “highlights the continuing need to watch closely for the emergence for new HIV variants, particularly in western central Africa,” said the researchers, led by Jean-Christophe Plantier of the University of Rouen, France.,The three previously known HIV strains are related to the simian virus that occurs in chimpanzees.,
,
,The most likely explanation for the new find is gorilla-to-human transmission, Plantier’s team said. But they added they cannot rule out the possibility that the new strain started in chimpanzees and moved into gorillas and then humans, or moved directly from chimpanzees to both gorillas and humans.,The 62-year-old patient tested positive for HIV in 2004, shortly after moving to Paris from Cameroon, according to the researchers. She had lived near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, but said she had no contact with apes or bush meat, a name often given to meat from wild animals in tropical countries.,The woman currently shows no signs of AIDS and remains untreated, though she still carries the virus, the researchers said.,How widespread this strain is remains to be determined. Researchers said it could be circulating unnoticed in Cameroon or elsewhere. The virus’ rapid replication indicates that it is adapted to human cells, the researchers reported.,
,
,A separate paper, also in Nature Medicine, reports that people with genital herpes remain at increased risk of HIV infection even after the herpes sores have healed and the skin appears normal.,The researchers found that long after the areas where the herpes sores existed seem to be clear, they still have immune-cell activity that can encourage HIV infection.,Herpes is marked by recurring outbreaks and has been associated with higher rates of infection with HIV. It had been thought that the breaks in the skin were the reason for higher HIV rates, but a study last year found that treatment of herpes with drugs did not reduce the HIV risk.,
,
,The researchers tested the skin of herpes patients for several weeks after their sores had healed and found that, compared with other genital skin, from twice to 37 times more immune cells remained at the locations where the sores had been.,“Understanding that even treated (herpes) infections provide a cellular environment conducive to HIV infection suggests new directions for HIV prevention research,” commented Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. — AP"

Commercialisation of education was coming full circle now after the new education policy was announced in the country in 1986, he noted.,The 1986 education policy was aimed purely at closure of government schools and colleges by not improving the quality of education and infrastructure and creating an impression that only private sector education would help students come good, he alleged.

We need to show love and affection, not stigma,” she pleaded. Many groups of sexuality minorities and nearly 100 PLHIV from various organisations across the State participated in the programme. The meet holds importance because of the National AIDS Control Programme III of NACO envisages to “Halt and reverse the HIV epidemic over the next five years.”"

An attempt to mitigate the sufferings of kids with AIDS

,NEW DELHI: It was a meeting of hearts as parliamentarians and those from fields as diverse as cinema and cricket had an interface with children affected by HIV/AIDS here on Thursday.,The reassurance that they will do their best to drum up support for the HIV/AIDS Bill that is aimed at mitigating the impact of the epidemic on women and children was music to the ears of all those who were curious to know certain provisions of the Bill.,In his inaugural speech, senior Congress leader Oscar Fernandes said he first realised the terrible consequence of the AIDS epidemic when he met a jawan suffering from the disease. “The jawan told me that he was suffering from HIV and would no longer be allowed to enter my office. His parents had ostracised him and he was dejected. I realised that AIDS was no longer restricted to statistics but had entered our homes. My first reaction was to save my children. My daughter has done an internship at the United Nations and has been involved in youth forum leadership to keep HIV at bay. Even though there are other contentious issues, I want to assert that it will be our priority to table the Bill in Parliament.”,Bollywood film-maker Nagesh Kukunoor said it was much easier making movies than speaking from the same platform where Mr. Fernandes had delivered such an inspiring speech.,“While I was making Rockford I had a bad car accident near Salem and was bleeding profusely. I was rushed to a small government hospital. Even though I was in a semi-conscious state, I told the doctor that under no circumstances he should give me blood transfusion. Even in that vulnerable position I had fear of contacting the disease. I appeal to the powers that be to push forward the Bill.”,Pitching for the early passage of the Bill to enable children affected by the disease to get their due rights, cricketer Virender Sehwag said even though players were spending a lot of time on the field yet they were aware of social issues plaguing the society.,“When I made my debut in 2001, Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid supported various causes. It is sad that nobody wants to talk to children affected by HIV/AIDS. As a cricketer I want to reassure the children present here that they will get their rights. I want all of you to live your live fully.”,Union Minister of State for Rural Development Agatha Sangma said even though her tenure as an MP and Minister has just begun she realises her responsibility as a parliamentarian to get the Bill passed.,“Each one of us has to work in a particular role to see to it that the Bill is passed without any further delay. Our parliamentarians are knowledgeable and are aware of the issue. I will muster support among MPs for this important Bill.” The interface was organised by Plan India, a child-centred development organisation."

Aid for child illnesses stalls amid focus on AIDS fight

,Diarrhoea kills 1.5 million young children a year in developing countries — more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined — but only four in 10 of those who need the oral rehydration solution that can prevent death for pennies get it.,“All the attention has gone to more glamorous diseases, but this basic thing has been left behind,” said Mickey Chopra, chief of health at UNICEF, which is trying to put diarrhoea back on the global health agenda. “It’s a forgotten disease.”,His observation lies at the heart of a wider debate over whether the United States and other rich nations spend too much on AIDS, which requires lifelong medications, compared with diarrhoea and the other leading killer of children, pneumonia, both of which can be treated inexpensively.,The debate is flaring at a time of great opportunity and risk. Recent data has documented remarkable progress in reducing child mortality and treating people with AIDS. Foreign assistance, which has often delivered disappointing results, is helping save millions of lives, the new figures show.,But as the United States and other rich nations hit by the global financial crisis face their own daunting challenges, there is heightened competition for foreign assistance. President Barack Obama has proposed a 2 per cent increase in HIV/AIDS spending for 2010 and a 6 per cent rise for maternal and child health, according to the Global Health Council, but the disparity in American spending on AIDS and the big child killers remains stark.,In Africa’s two most populous nations, Nigeria and Ethiopia, the number of people who died of AIDS in 2007 — 237,000 — was less than half the 540,000 children under 5 who died of pneumonia and diarrhoea. But this year, the $750 million the United States is spending on HIV/AIDS in the two countries not only dwarfs the $35 million it is spending there on maternal and child health, but is also more than the $646 million it is spending on maternal and child health in all the world’s countries combined.,“AIDS is still underfunded, no question,” said Jeremy Shiffman, a political scientist at Syracuse University who has documented global health spending patterns. “But maternal, newborn and child mortality is a tremendous tragedy and gets peanuts.”,Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel — a bioethicist, White House official and brother of Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff — has contended that international aid for health is limited and would save more lives if increases focused on maternal health and the “mundane but deadly diseases” that kill young children. Such choices are necessary, he and a co-author wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April, “if the United States is going to shoulder the burden of choosing which lives to save in the developing world.”,
,
,Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist, countered that wealthy donors still spent far too little on global health and rejected what he called the wrong-headed idea that “we need to make a terrible and tragic choice between AIDS or pneumonia.” The United States has invested heavily in the fight against AIDS, and other wealthy nations should pick up more of the cost of other global health priorities, he said. “Rather than tearing down what’s working, we should continue to invest in what’s needed,” he said.,Mr. Obama has promised to put greater focus on child and maternal health and proposed a 53 percent increase next year in money to fight malaria, a major killer of African children, the Global Health Council estimated. But he has also committed to major increases in money to fight AIDS in coming years that, if enacted, would ensure AIDS remained America’s global health priority, constituting over 70 per cent of its global health spending, he said.,International commitments to combat HIV and AIDS rose at an average annual rate of 48 per cent from 1998 to 2007, reaching $7.4 billion and making up almost half of donor financing for global health, according to Prof. Shiffman’s analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.,Still, more than half the people with the disease who need drug treatment still are not getting it. Two million died in 2007, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.,The toll of women and children who die of easily preventable or curable conditions is even higher. Pneumonia alone killed two million children under age 5, and diarrhoea 1.5 million more, out of the almost nine million young children who died last year.,Dr. Olivier Fontaine, who described himself as the only person at WHO working full time on childhood diarrhoeal diseases, said health ministry managers in poor countries know diarrhoea is a crucial cause of child mortality, but focus on other diseases that have gotten more attention and financing from abroad.,Two days after her month-old son’s bout of diarrhea began, Marcia Mankense, 23, took him to a hospital here in Johannesburg where a doctor administered fluids through an intravenous line threaded into his scalp. Before his birth, she said, no one told her she should give him oral rehydration salts — known as ORS — as soon as he got diarrhea, though she was counselled on the need to get tested for HIV. Nor did anyone give her a packet of the salts to take home.,“He’s my firstborn and I know nothing about kids,” she said, exhausted next to his crib after days of vigil. “I just feel like I need to be here for him. What if he’s crying?”,Public health experts agree there is tremendous potential to lower child deaths from diarrhoea and pneumonia substantially. New methods of distributing rehydration salts and cheap zinc tablets, also recommended for diarrhoea, are being tested, including giving them away during national campaigns to hand out antimalarial bed nets and to vaccinate children against measles.,
,
,“Everyone should have ORS at home like we have Band-aids,” Fontaine said.,For an extra $3 billion to $4 billion in coming years, children in poor countries could be inoculated against pneumonia and the rotavirus that causes about a third of diarrhoea deaths, according to the GAVI Alliance, a broad group of donors.,On the diarrhoea ward at the hospital in Johannesburg, most of the babies and young children had mothers patiently sitting next to their cribs, comforting them. But one little boy, 2 months old, was alone. His mother, a 10th grader, was at school. He had come in dehydrated, with sunken eyes, too enervated to even cry. But after being given fluids intravenously, life flowed back into him.,When he howled, a nurse or one of the mothers would look into his eyes. He would fall quiet, his cries muting to soft mewling, his eyes widening curiously.,“He wasn’t even crying when he got here,” Mankense said happily. “Now we can hear his voice. He’s naughty!”"

Hopes of AIDS vaccine breakthrough dashed

,
,The first Aids vaccine to show an encouraging result in clinical trials is only modestly effective and did not protect those at highest risk of HIV, it emerged on 20 October, as U.S. and Thai researchers revealed their full results in Paris.,The announcement last month that the controversial $105 million trial carried out in Thailand had unexpectedly been successful took experts by surprise and sparked excitement around the world amid speculation that the steady spread of HIV/Aids could before long be checked.,However, it is now clear that this is a long way wide of the mark.,The full results, presented at the Aids vaccine conference in Paris and published immediately online by the New England Journal of Medicine reveal that:,- The vaccine did not protect those at high risk of HIV infection, such as sex workers and intravenous drug users.,- The protective effect was greatest in the first 12 months and then seemed to diminish.,- When those who did not get all six vaccine shots were taken out of the analysis, the positive result was statistically insignificant.,
,
,Some scientists and campaigners in Paris nevertheless hailed the results, if not as a triumph, then as a beacon of hope. Dr Nelson Michael of the US army — the US military had run the research programme with the Thai government — said scientists would now be working intensely to pick up clues to future Aids vaccine development from the results of the trial. “It is a signpost for vaccine development,” he said.,“This was a yes-we-can moment: the opportunity to become enthusiastic. The door has cracked open. We are all going to try to collectively crash through it.”,But Seth Berkley, president of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, which evaluates and channels funds into trials, said he thought the regime tested in Thailand would be taken no further.,The vaccines involved — AidsVax, which previously failed in a trial in Thailand on its own, and Alvac — were 15 years old.,
,
,“That’s why there was scientific controversy about starting this trial,” he said. “If you were going to start again, you might use one of the more robust vaccines we have [in the lab] today.,“We don’t have a vaccine on the horizon. It isn’t the Thai one or one of the others. That’s why we have to have the patience for this marathon rather than a sprint.”,The Thai trial, given the name RV144, was controversial from the start because it involved two vaccines given together, one of which had previously failed to protect people from HIV while the other had not been tested alone.,Many people felt the $105million it cost could be better spent.,More than 16,400 Thai men and women aged 18 to 30 who did not have HIV were recruited and randomly assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo.,They were given six shots over six months: two of Alvac followed by two more sessions where they were injected with both vaccines. They were tested for HIV every six months, and counselled on how to avoid it for the next three years.,By the end of the trial only 125 people had become infected with HIV. In the announcement of the headline results last month, it was said that 51 of those given the vaccine had become HIV positive compared with 74 in the placebo group, which gives a statistically significant efficacy of 31 per cent.,
,
,But many volunteers did not get all six vaccinations, taking the numbers down from around 8,000 in each group to around 6,000. Removing those who did not get all the six vaccinations was done in accordance to the protocol.,Among those people, there were 50 infections on placebo and 36 on the vaccine, which gives an efficacy of 26 per cent but is not statistically significant, meaning it could happen by chance.

None of them look at the religion, culture or nationality of the beneficiaries. This facility for HIV positive children is proof enough to show that a little change can change a lot in the world,” he said.,He, however, added that the home was accessible only to a few children and the government has to step in to reach out and rehabilitate the thousands who need such care.,Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control (APAC) project, said that the government has set up a corpus fund of Rs.5 crore in the recent budget for this purpose. “It will be used to provide education and health for infected as well as affected (loss of a parent to HIV) children.”,According to him, there are 17,000 HIV positive children in the State and homes are not the only solution. “To let the children live in their own community instead of isolating them would be the best solution.

More takers for voluntary HIV testing in Puducherry

M,PUDUCHERRY: Voluntary testing for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) has been finding more takers year after year across all four regions of the Union Territory. This trend, according to Pondicherry AIDS Control Society (PACS), will go a long way in de-stigmatising the test among the general population.,More people are coming to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for voluntary HIV testing. Initially, these centres motivated persons belonging to the high-risk groups to come for testing. But now, the general public are being motivated to take the test, project director of PACS Gilbert Fernandez said.,Voluntary HIV testing saw 14,000 takers in 2005, followed by 17,000 in 2006. The number increased to 20,000 in 2007 and 21,500 in 2008. “Increased level of awareness is one of the reasons for so many persons to come for the test. Many young women have become aware and opt for testing,” he said.,For instance, out of the total persons who came for testing in 2007, 11,000 were men and 9,000 were women. Similarly, 13,500 men and 8,000 women took the voluntary testing in 2008, according to PACS.,“This trend has definitely brought down the percentage of positivity from six per cent in 2005 to four per cent in 2008. A larger section of the general population are utilising the testing services, leading to a downward trend in positivity,” Dr. Fernandez said.,Nearly 64,000 persons volunteered for testing in 60 days during a special drive held two years ago for the general population, he recalled.,There are 10 ICTCs across the Union Territory — six in Puducherry, two in Karaikal and one each in Mahe and Yanam. The ICTCs function at Odiansalai, Government Maternity Hospital, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Karikalampakkam and Manadipet in Puducherry.,“We will be starting two more centres at Thirunallar in Karaikal and Pallur in Mahe this year for an increased reach. We will be appointing lab technicians and counsellors,” he said.,As the next step, PACS plans to establish ICTCs at 24-hour primary health centres in the Union Territory. Already, six to seven PHCs have been identified, he stated.,The voluntary HIV testing would enable people to know their status like in any other condition, he said, adding, “Many persons with no high-risk behaviour such as antenatal mothers and newly wed women have tested positive for HIV as the partner might be a person with risky behaviour. Individuals with non-risky behaviour and general population should take the test. This will de-stigmatise the test.”"

For a general public the testing would be similar to the blood test for malaria.,The project director of OSACS, Alekh Chandra Padhiary said the major advantage of the ‘whole blood finger-prick’ technology is that for it there would be no need to separate serum and red blood cells of a blood sample to test for HIV. This technology has been quite successful in Africal countries where most people are being tested for HIV by this new and fast technology. The conventional HIV testing kits being used now accept only serum collected from blood samples to test for HIV antibody. The presence of HIV antibody in one’s blood hints at HIV infection.,A centrifuge which separates the serum from the blood is a major need of conventional HIV testing technologies.,The new technology being tried now accepts whole blood and can tell HIV status by a simple finger prick.,A workshop was organised in Bhubaneswar on Thursday for the implementation of this HIV testing technology in Orissa. It was attended by a team from the NACO, officials of the OSACS, Chief District Medical Officers (CDMO) of Ganjam, Angul, Koraput, Bolangir, Balasore and Bhadrak districts.,These are HIV prone districts of Orissa.,The process of HIV testing through ‘whole blood finger-prick’ is expected to be first introduced in Ganjam district, the most AIDS prone district of Orissa.,
,
,Through this technique the Auxiliary Nurse cum Midwives (ANM) of remote areas would be able to test blood samples of pregnant women so in case of HIV infection they could be taken to the Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres early to save the stillborns from HIV infection.,In Ganjam district married women usually get infected by their HIV infected migrant labourer husbands."

Hurdle crossed, progress likely on AIDS Bill
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Hurdle-crossed-progress-likely-on-AIDS-Bill/article16492382.ece,"Aarti Dhar,NEW DELHI: With the Delhi High Court decriminalising homosexuality by striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and the government deciding not to challenge the judgment, more progress is expected to be made on the Bill aimed at preventing discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients.,Oscar Fernandes, convener of the Parliamentarians’ Forum on HIV/AIDS, said Section 377 was a major hurdle to the proposed legislation. “If the Supreme Court upholds the judgment, one can expect the Bill to come up in the next six months.”,The draft Bill was ready, he said speaking at a function organised by the UNAIDS here to “celebrate” the High Court verdict.,
,
,Mr. Fernandes suggested that every pregnant woman be tested for HIV to ensure that the disease was not transmitted to the child. “This should be done right at the panchayat level as mother-to-child transmission is a violation of the human rights of the child. Unfortunately, we cannot make it mandatory since we do not have the mechanism for this.” To achieve this, institutional delivery had to be encouraged. At present the percentage of mother-to-child transmission was about 18 per cent.,
,
,As part of his first official visit to India as UNAIDS executive director, Michel Sidibe participated in the function. He described the Delhi High Court judgment as historic, but said decriminalising drug use and sex work was still a long way off.,
,
,Criminalising any group would increase stigma and discrimination as well as its vulnerability to HIV infection. Experience showed that effective responses to HIV were those based on respect for human rights, tolerance and access to HIV services, Mr. Sidibe said."

Kannan, Superintendent of the Madurai Central Prison.,He made the submission in a counter affidavit filed before the Madras High Court Bench here in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by a lawyer who claimed that people with HIV/AIDS ought to have been lodged in separate cells.,“The Government as well as medical experts have declared that HIV is not infectious and persons affected by HIV should not be separated from others. A similar opinion is expressed by the prison medical officer too,” the Superintendent said.,A Division Bench comprising Justice Chitra Venkataraman and Justice M. Duraiswamy dismissed the PIL petition after accepting the statement made by the official. “We do not find any justification to grant the prayer in the present petition,” they said.,Mr. Kannan, however, admitted that the Central prison here was overcrowded. Stating that steps were being taken to ease the congestion, he denied allegations that overcrowding had lead to inhumane treatment of the inmates.,As on August 21, 2009, a total of 1,528 prisoners (including 797 convicts, 662 remand prisoners and those facing trials and 69 persons detained under the Goondas Act) were lodged in the prison as against the authorised capacity of 1,252 inmates.,“Though the Madurai Central Prison is overcrowded, the condition in the prison is not inhuman and the prisoners are provided with all basic amenities like food, shelter, water, clothes, medical treatment and recreational facilities,” the official said.,He pointed out that two sub-jails in Dindigul and Virudhunagar had been upgraded as district jails recently thereby reducing new admissions in the Madurai prison. A sub-jail in Ramanthapuram district would also be upgraded soon. The Superintendent further said, “prisoners who are found to be mentally ill are being separated from other prisoners and guarded properly. They are not allowed to mingle with other healthy prisoners.”,He also said that the Principal District Judge, the Chief Judicial Magistrate and the Joint Director of Health Services who visited the prison on several occasions between July 12, 2008 and March 21 this year had recorded their satisfaction over the facilities available."

They could get access to all tests under one roof, including enumeration of CD4 cells, most important tests to take decision whether to initiate therapy for HIV patients or not, thanks to the installation of most advanced BD FACS Cluster Determiner 4 equipment at Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre in Dindigul Headquarter Government Hospital. Commissioning work was over. It would be put to use in a day or two, according to sources in the GH.,The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) has offered this equipment costing Rs.8 lakh to the GH. “It is a boon to HIV patients and physicians. It is a new and reliable test for the enumeration of CD4 cells in peripheral blood,” said doctors in the GH.,With the installation of this equipment, the ART Centre has wiped out its last resource-constraint. The CD4 lymphocytes (T-helper cells) were the major target cells of HIV infection. Progressive decline in CD4 levels, caused by various pathological processes associated with HIV infection, would increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections. The CD4 counts would serve as the major clinical indicators of immune competence in HIV patients. It would also help doctors in decision-making whether to initiate the therapy or not, doctors added.,If the CD counts level was less than 200, Anti-Retroviral treatment would be commenced immediately as this level indicated severe weakened immune system. If the level was more than 200, effective counselling would be given to patients to maintain nutrition levels.,The ART centre had been referring on an average 250 cases to Madurai for this test every month. From now, they could avail this facility in Dindigul GH itself.,The ART Centre also has HIV detection facilities, ART treatment, Legal Aid Cell for persons living with HIV and tests and treatment facilities for all venereal diseases under single roof.

If people shy away from talking about AIDS, it’s difficult to contain it, she said. Besides the number of people using intravenous drugs was going up. Also to contain HIV, it’s necessary to have an open debate about gay rights, particularly in the light of Supreme Court judgment on Article 377.,On the government’s efforts to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS, she said in spite of the high cost the government was spending a lot of money on giving ART medicines. Population Services International’s Program Director (Project Connect) Atul Kapoor said the public-private partnership that brought together several agencies could serve to encourage other public/private insurance companies to examine insurance to PLHIV.,

In Visakhapatnam it had gone up from .35 per cent in 2007 to .75 per cent in 2008.

,
,It's been a bad few months for HIV prevention. We've learned that our best candidates for vaccines and virus-killing microbicides don't work. Now we're clutching at another straw: maybe we can treat our way out of the HIV epidemic.,At an HIV research meeting this week, boffins from the World Health Organisation revived a mathematical model that shows that if we test everyone in Africa for HIV once a year and give everyone who tests positive expensive drugs right away and for the rest of their lives, we'll wipe out new HIV infections within seven years. That's because HIV is passed on most easily when there's lots of virus in the infected person's blood and body fluids. Antiretroviral medicines cut the “viral load” (the amount of virus in the body), so they make it more difficult to pass on HIV. Ergo, more treatment means fewer new infections.,Sadly, it's not that simple. For one thing, HIV is most infectious in the few months after a person is first infected. Even if everyone got tested annually, we'd miss most of these new infections. Second, people's viral load spikes upwards if they get another sexually transmitted infection (STI), or if they stop taking their medicine because the clinic runs out of stock, the meds make them feel sick, or they went on a three-day bender and forgot their pills. Interrupting treatment also allows the virus to develop resistance to drugs, and that leads to more spikes in viral load. Most importantly, antiretrovirals keep you alive and well enough to be out there meeting new sex partners. That's a good thing, obviously, but it also means that people who have HIV are going to have more chances to pass it on during those times when their viral load is spiky.,There's more. In countries like the U.K. where treatment has been available for over a decade, AIDS has virtually disappeared. HIV, unfortunately, has not. A few years after antiretrovirals became widely available, new infections among gay men in the U.K. began to rise. We've seen the same thing in Australia, the United States and practically everywhere else we have data. One reason for that is that gay men use condoms less now than they did when HIV = AIDS = a horrible death. Now, though, HIV = a pill every day. Boring, but not the end of the world, unless you're the taxpayer picking up the tab for it or the epidemiologist worrying that drug-resistant strains of HIV will reignite AIDS.,On top of that, many people assume that if the person they're having sex with is infected, they'll be on meds and so not very infectious. Which may be true if they're not in that early peak of infectiousness, have taken all their pills diligently, and don't have another STI. Though since condom use is dropping across the board, other STI rates are soaring. In short, more people living with HIV, combined with more unprotected sex, is outweighing the effects of lower viral load in places where the population is well informed, HIV testing is actively promoted, and treatment has been free and universally available. But in Africa it will be different.,Our computer model assumes every African will get tested for HIV every year, everyone who tests positive will start taking antiretrovirals immediately and 98 out of 100 will never miss a dose. On top of that, though gay men in rich countries use condoms far less now than they did before we had antiretrovirals, we assume that heterosexuals in Africa are going to use them more once the most visible and frightening face of AIDS disappears.,On the strength of this model, which bears as much relation to reality as a British MP's expense claim, we are going to hail expanded HIV treatment in Africa as the new answer to prevention.

Each club has ten children from the Red Ribbon Clubs that have been promoted in the schools by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society – TANSACS.,The club members get adequate training in story developing and story telling techniques as also life skills by competent resource persons.,Around 45 trainings programmes have been conducted for them. During the training, adequate care was taken to make communication participatory and lively.,The story telling clubs have come out with 504 short stories on stigma /discrimination, some of them compete in quality and content that is deficient, by and large, among the debutants.,The NGO (Vasantham Trust) was now in the process of editing and developing them into a structured syllabus to be taught in the weekly once Red Ribbon classes. It was presumed that one STC member should conduct story telling session to ten to fifteen members in the school. Moreover, the children were effective communicators at community and family level. The STC members were expected to sensitise about 18,500 school children and their family members indirectly on reducing stigma/ discrimination through this innovative child friendly approach.,This was the first and bold attempt that the children prepare their own syllabus for addressing stigma, said the Headmaster of Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School, Marthandam, Lawrence.,This was an innovative idea recognised first by the World Bank when Vasantham Trust participated in the open competition for NGOs of nine South Asian countries on ‘Tackling HIV/AIDS’, said the Chief Educational Officer, Ponniha."

NGOs join hands for HIV palliative care
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/NGOs-join-hands-for-HIV-palliative-care/article16269708.ece,"The importance of giving palliative care to those living with HIV/AIDS is something that even these patients are yet to fully comprehend. As in the case of any chronic disease, palliative care has an important role in the care and support of them.,With even the National AIDS Control Organisation yet to come out with a clear policy or guidelines on this, Pallium India, a pioneer in the area of palliative care in the country, and Family Health International (FHI), an international non-governmental organisation working in the area of public health, are joining hands to develop an appropriate model of integrating palliative care with the government's HIV care programme.,Kerala's unique model of community-oriented palliative care delivery system having caught worldwide attention, a 10-member team of FHI doctors and researchers had been in the State capital for several days in May, going on field visits with Pallium India health volunteers and holding consultations with experts here.,“FHI is working in India closely with the Centre as well as the State governments on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, TB and health systems strengthening. Though HIV care has expanded much, palliative care is quite ignored, at present. But it is very important as those infected with HIV can go on to live for many years, with the burden of several opportunistic infections, which worsens as the infection progresses,” Ashok Agarwal, a project directors of FHI, said.,
,
,The role of palliative care starts right from the time HIV infection is diagnosed, when the person goes through intense psychological and social distress. Palliative care goes beyond the medical management of infectious, neurological or oncological complications of HIV/AIDS and managing the pain from side effects of drugs to addressing comprehensively the problems the patient faces through a continuum of HIV infection, Dr. Agarwal said.,In most parts of the country, even the medical fraternity is yet to comprehend that palliative care is not just terminal care. Many doctors still have only a vague idea about palliative care and are not knowledgeable or trained to use morphine for pain management.,“Pain is not taken into account in HIV care. It could be the side effects of anti-retroviral therapy or co-morbidities or it could be discomfort of diarrhoea, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness, fatigue and confusion, some of the many symptoms of HIV. But even people living with HIV just suffer this silently, thinking that it is ‘normal,'” M.R. Rajagopal, chairman of Pallium India, said.,“We will take up the task of advocacy so that a national policy on the palliative care component in HIV care and support can be evolved and made a part of our national programme,” Dr. Agarwal said."

South Africa's HIV carer children
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/South-Africas-HIV-carer-children/article16262512.ece,"Not far from the manicured South African pitches where millionaire footballers are capturing the world's attention, Oxford academics are working with local researchers to investigate an African reality that will linger long after the World Cup circus has left. Interviewing more than 7,000 people in some of the country's poorest townships, they are studying the mental health and education of a generation of South African children who are growing up caring for relatives with HIV and Aids.,This is the Young Carers South Africa project, a collaboration between Oxford University, the South African government, and three South African universities, as well as a host of NGOs. The two-year study, involving 35 field staff, including local managers, interviewers and volunteers, is working to build a huge pool of data that will inform social policy not only for South Africa, but for other countries with high rates of AIDS and HIV around the world.,The project is spearheaded by Lucie Cluver, of Oxford's department of social policy and social work, whose inspiration was her PhD research — a study of 1,000 children who had been orphaned by Aids. She discovered that the children suffered higher levels of psychological distress than orphans whose parents had died of other causes, and were also more likely to contract HIV themselves. To raise awareness of the findings, Cluver sent her research to a South African professor, who introduced her to the government's then minister of social development, Zola Skweyiya. The next day he called her to a meeting and said her research “needed to become a national study”, Cluver says.,Two years on, the Young Carers project now has teams in three South African provinces, interviewing 6,000 children and 1,500 of their parents or guardians about their access to social welfare grants, health visitors, and free school meals. With the help of local teenagers, they have made questionnaires that also ask about issues such as stigma and bullying, social support, parent-child relationships and carers' access to anti-retroviral medicine.,“We interview children face-to-face, somewhere private — at home, at school, sometimes in the yard,” says Cluver, “even though some of the sites are only accessible by tiny 20-seater planes or 4x4 vehicles. The interviews are amazing — the kids are often so happy to have someone to talk to about the secret illness in their family. What's difficult is the circumstances in which they live. We've worked through taxi wars and riots in Cape Town, gangsters in Durban, and cholera outbreaks in Mpumalanga. Our researchers walk through open sewers and over rubbish heaps, into homes which desperately poor people keep spotlessly clean.”,Shockingly, so far, the research suggests children who live with AIDS-sufferers have as much psychological distress as those who have been orphaned by AIDS. “It's because of the stigma that comes with having HIV in the family,” Cluver says. “Kids report being gossiped about, and teased, and having people scared to touch them.” The early findings show that about 40 per cent of kids in AIDS-sick homes are missing or have dropped out of school, compared to 22 per cent in homes affected by other illnesses, and 5 per cent in healthy homes. Almost a third of the young carers — sometimes as young as eight — report carrying out intimate care, such as washing sick people, helping them go to the toilet and cleaning their wounds.,“The kids aren't passive victims — they're kids just like all others, wanting to be Beyonce or Usher. They're so excited about the World Cup that when they chose pseudonyms for their stories to be reported in our research, half of them used football players' names,” Cluver says.,“They worry about the same things as first-world kids — one 13-year-old girl cried throughout her interview because kids at school were calling her ‘baboon face'” But when these children get home, “they wash blankets, feed younger siblings, rub the backs of people with tuberculosis, make sure their parents take their anti-retrovirals, miss school for hospital trips, and queue to get medication for their carers who are too sick to stand,” Cluver reports. “When they get to school they're so worried about the sick person at home that they can't concentrate.” More children will face this situation. In 2008, 1.4 million South African children had lost a parent to HIV/AIDS; that's expected to rise above two million by 2015. When I ask Cluver what she hopes to be the impact of her study, her response is passionate: “We don't hope — we'll make something happen: this study is science to serve policy.” The researchers are already giving regular updates to the South African government as well as NGOs such as USAID, Unicef and Child Welfare South Africa. They hold community meetings, and speak to schools, social workers and hospital staff about the issues the kids are raising, and how best to support them. “We're also making two movies — directed, filmed and edited by the kids and their carers — to deal with the stigma surrounding Aids,” says Cluver.,The study aims to reveal the scale of the difficulties faced by HIV/AIDS-affected families. “There has been no large-scale research in the developing world to understand how much work these kids are taking on in the home, and the effects,” Cluver says. “We need to understand if these kids are more depressed, traumatised or anxious than other children, and whether they are struggling at school. We need to know if they're unable to access health services, or are catching illnesses like TB from people they're looking after. Then, we need to know what can help them.” Both the South African government and NGOs are eager for the findings, Cluver says, in order to adapt their policies to help these children. She is hopeful about the study's impact, but admits that in the meantime, the researchers feel powerless.,One 13-year-old told of just folding his arms at lunchtime at school, “because we don't have money to buy food now that my mother cannot work”. An 11-year-old girl described pushing her mum to the clinic in a wheelbarrow, and “bringing her a glass of water because she cannot get out of bed”.,“The parents tell our researchers about horrific experiences and expect to receive help for their situation, but all we can do is give them a biscuit and a certificate. There's nothing we can do but research,” says Cluver. “It's hard to face families who have shared their life stories and then have to walk out of the door.” ,

Free bus passes, escort for AIDS patients

Chandravadan.,He was in the city to participate in a meeting of elected representatives on HIV situation in Visakhapatnam district organised by the AP Legislators Forum on HIV and AIDS.,In a chat with newsmen who met him on the sidelines of the meet, Dr. Chandravadan said that the free bus pass was meant to enable HIV patients visit their nearest ART Centres for checkup and treatment. An attendant would also be allowed to travel free as escort to the patient. The modalities were being worked out and a G.O. would soon be issued in this regard. The move would entail an annual expenditure of Rs.5 crores to the State Government.,He said that the State Government was the first in the country to announce pension to AIDS patients. This would be in addition to the normal pension, which Government employees were entitled to after their retirement from service. The pension amount would be credited to the bank account of the patients and it could be withdrawn through ATMs.,He said of the 34,000 persons, who had applied for ‘Sahara' cards, 26,000 had already been issued the same. These cards would enable the patients to avail themselves of these benefits. A new innovative campaign on AIDS awareness, designed to focus on the clients of high risk groups, would be launched in a couple of months, he said."

First to detect HIV in India

The city's first voluntary HIV testing and counselling centre was her institutive. Recipient of various awards for her meritorious service in the field of HIV/AIDS, she successfully runs an NGO and supports people living with the virus.,Dr. Suniti Solomon, founder-director of Y R Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) in Chennai has come a long way. Her milestone moment came in May 1986 when she was working as a Professor of Microbiology at the prestigious Madras Medical College.,“Those were the days when I was reading a lot of foreign journals on the HIV and its effect in the U.S. In a quest to determine whether the virus was spreading here, my postgraduate student Nirmala and I identified a few female sex-workers lodged at the government home on Kutchery Road in Mylapore,” says Dr. Suniti.,Six blood samples that were initially tested positive were sent to Christian Medical College in Vellore for an ELISA test (as the facility was then available only in CMC) for reconfirmation. The samples were later sent to the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, United States for further confirmation.,Sending shockwaves throughout the country in the May of 1986, Dr. Suniti came out with the results on the sexually transmitted virus. The findings were even read out in the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly.,There was no looking back for the doctor who once aspired to become a neurologist. As the second step towards her new area of research, Dr. Suniti helped set-up the Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV at the Institute of Microbiology in MMC.,At a time when physicians feared to deal with HIV, Dr. Suniti decided to make an alternative career in it. “I took an early retirement and started my organisation in November 1993 with just three people. We did a lot of tough ground work. We had to erect huts in the Pondy Bazaar area and treat patients as no hospital came forward to admit HIV positive persons,” recollects the doctor on the days of hardship.,YRG Care with over 300 staff and having handled 14,428 patients (till 2009) is today one of the pioneers in offering care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS.,Dr. Suniti's unforgettable moment at work came in 1992 when she treated a pregnant woman tested positive. “She delivered a beautiful baby boy who was also tested positive. He led a healthy life with the support of medications until January last. He passed away at the age of 17,” she adds.,Today, according to Dr. Suniti, HIV positive patients have a big ray of hope thanks to the advancement in medical facilities and easy availability of antiretroviral drugs. “Earlier, I use to cry with my patients. Today, if any patient cries, I will whack that person,” she says with a laughter informing that people with HIV today can lead a healthy life like any other person. According to Dr. Suniti, it is the stigma which kills people and not the disease.,Being a successful woman in her field, Dr. Suniti has no plans of retirement. On her dream project she says, “I want to work for the welfare of little girls and boys who are victims of sexual abuse.”,Away from work Dr. Suniti Solomon is a Sudoku enthusiast and she loves spending time with her two Golden Retrievers back home.,Petlee Peter,

Better news on the HIV front
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Better-news-on-the-HIV-front/article16050375.ece,"Although nearly 7,500 new cases of HIV infection are reported every day globally, the good news is that incidence rates are steadily declining in most parts of the world. HIV incidence has fallen by more than 17 per cent globally over the past nine years. But what is of greater significance is that it is happening in many African countries, the core of the epidemic and which for years had a disproportionately high number of new cases. According to the latest UNAIDS report, the incidence rate has dropped by more than 25 per cent in 22 sub-Saharan African countries, and many of them are well on the way to achieving the U.N. target of reducing HIV rates among the young this year. They include Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe — some of the countries with the largest HIV epidemics in the world. Better awareness of the risks and education on the different modes of transmission has been identified as the key factor that made it possible. A study published in the , in April this year attributes the decline in Zimbabwe to changes in sexual behaviour, particularly the use of condoms in non-regular partnerships. A dramatic reduction was also seen in the case of women in the 15-24 age group in South Africa. Despite the group reporting the highest incidence rate, the drop has been nearly 60 per cent between 2005 and 2008.,In a striking contrast to the picture emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, HIV incidence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is showing an upward trend. Russia has the largest AIDS epidemic in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Injection drug use is the main mode of transmission across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Similarly, once praised for drastically cutting down the prevalence rate from 30 per cent in the late 1980s to six per cent by late 1990s, HIV prevalence in Uganda is on the rise once again. Widespread use of anti-retroviral treatment and the resultant reduction in mortality has led to the increase. But the availability of drugs has also meant greater indulgence in risky behaviour. This, combined with the scaling down of prevention programmes due to complacency, has played a major role in pushing up the incidence rate. Uganda offers a good case study for India. The prevalence rate in India is low at approximately 0.36 per cent. The lesson in this for India is that there should be no let up in the drive to increase awareness and risk avoidance in the campaigns for AIDS prevention. There is absolutely no room for complacency on this vital front."

Living with HIV/AIDS, but dying of TB: Study

,
,NEW DELHI: People living with HIV/AIDS don’t get life-saving tuberculosis treatment on time and the delay puts their life at risk, according to a recent multi-centre study conducted by the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS with support from Advocacy to Control TB Internationally.,The study indicates significant delays in both detecting and treating TB especially among people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. “Nearly half the 2.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in India contract TB, making it the leading cause of death. Yet less than 5 per cent are automatically tested for TB,” notes the study.,The study also points out that lack of awareness and knowledge about TB ranks high among patients and causes delay in seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Distance from the nearest TB service delivery point is also a key barrier from the provider end, with average travel times exceeding 90 minutes for over 50 p.c. of the population surveyed.,Nearly a third of the surveyed population also reported paying for their medications, indicating an incomplete reach and awareness of the free national TB control programme.,
,
,“People living with HIV/AIDS are among the most vulnerable in getting TB infections. Any delay in this vulnerable population getting life-saving TB treatments is also indicative of broad systemic issues of accessibility that need to be addressed quickly,” said the lead researcher on this study from the Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, Dr. Venkatesan Chakrapani.,“The delay in getting appropriate diagnosis for HIV-infected individuals also reflects on the failure to get newer diagnostic tests on to the market and in our health care delivery points,” he added.,The currently used standard microscopy-based sputum tests fail to detect TB in samples from people living with HIV and having infectious TB, leading to false negative tests and delays in getting a correct diagnosis.,Dr. Bobby John of Global Health Advocates and an adviser on the study said: “There needs to be a further deepening of the service delivery to avoid long travel times for sick people. Distance and poor understanding cause people to drop out of their medications more often than not.”,Ten per cent of the survey participants reported stopping their treatments for a week or more. Incomplete treatment adherence raises the risk of multi-drug resistant TB for the individual and in the community."

However, a patient with HIV+ status would not disclose it to one’s neighbour while the status of one’s diabetes and hypertension is proudly stated.,Ms. George stressed the need for sensitive reporting when dealing with children. Their rights are being infringed upon when the media shows their pictures stating their HIV+ status.

,Thrissur: A workshop on HIV/AIDS anti-stigma campaign organised jointly by the Thrissur Press Club and Rajagiri Outreach on Monday urged the media to play an active role in preventing and eliminating HIV-related stigma. The workshop pointed out that stigma was blocking access to HIV prevention, information, support and treatment services.,
,
,“Stigma and discrimination are among the worst consequences of the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The media should respect confidentiality. Fear of stigma and discrimination compel people living with HIV/AIDS to keep their medical status secret. There should be informed consent of HIV positive persons in regard to news coverage about them. Journalists should use language that is sensitive and politically correct. Avoid terms such as ‘promiscuous’, ‘sufferer’, ‘victim’ and ‘suspected of having HIV’. Sensationalism should be avoided at any cost,” the workshop said.,K. Ajith Kumar, assistant professor with the Thrissur Government Medical College, called upon reporters to follow the Press Council of India guidelines on coverage of HIV/AIDS.,The workshop also examined prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the State. In July 2009, Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy said the State had 10,491 people affected by HIV/AIDS (based on number of cases registered in Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres).,“The HIV epidemic in the State is mainly related to migration. Most of the men have been infected in cities outside Kerala through sex with women sex workers. The infected men in turn infect their spouses. For every two infected men, there is an infected woman. Of late, there has been a change in the pattern of infection. More infections are acquired now from within the State,” the workshop added.,Joy M. Mannur, president, Thrissur Press Club, presided. Varghese Palathingal, chairman, Mazhavillu District Committee, Laisa Paul, Childline Co-ordinator, and R.V. Jineshlal, Development Officer, Rajagiri Outreach, also spoke."

,Bangalore: In a scenario where 7,400 people contract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) every day in addition to the nearly four million people currently receiving treatment for the infection, the media has to play a pivotal role in influencing public opinion and removing the social stigma faced by people living with HIV/AIDS.,This was the subject of discussion at an editors’ symposium on HIV/AIDS, jointly organised by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS), Avahan — the India AIDS Initiative of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNAIDS, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) and the Centre for Advocacy and Research, here on Monday.,
,
,Making a presentation at the symposium, Health and Family Welfare Commissioner D.N. Nayak said lack of awareness and also social stigma had made matters worse for people living with HIV/AIDS.,“They are afraid and shy to get tested and avail treatment because they are worried of being shunned by society. This disease is now being treated as a social problem rather than a medical problem,” Mr. Nayak said.,
,
,Pointing out that the State Health Department was providing free counselling and treatment for infected persons, the Commissioner elaborated on the number of infected people in Karnataka.,
,
,KSAPS Project Director R.R. Jannu said there has been a sharper decline in HIV prevalence among younger women (under the age of 25). “This is an indication that there is a possible decline in the incidence of HIV in the general population,” he said.,Pointing out that districts in north Karnataka have a higher HIV prevalence among pregnant women, Mr. Jannu said, “However, there is a decline in HIV prevalence in this region to match the prevalence rates in districts of southern Karnataka.,
,
,The sentinel surveillance data also shows that there has been a sharper decline in the HIV prevalence among ante-natal clinic attendees in first referral units (from 1.6 per cent in 2003 to around 0.7 per cent in 2008) compared to those who attend district hospitals (from 1.3 per cent in 2003 to around 1.1 per cent in 2008).,“There are 34 anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres in the State and of these, the State-run Bowring and Lady Curzon Hosptial has been recognised as a centre of excellence by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for HIV/AIDS treatment centre,” Mr. Jannu said.,
,
,UNAIDS India representative Kasinath gave a presentation on the global scenario of the epidemic. “An estimated 33 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and there were 2.7 million new HIV infections and 2 million AIDS-related deaths last year. Globally, women account for half of all HIV infections,” he said.,
,
,“Nearly 4 million people are currently receiving treatment, while 9.7 people are still in need. For every two persons put on treatment, five more get infected. But the social stigma and misconceptions around HIV have forced people to shy away from treatment. That is why sensitive and responsible reporting is crucial,” he said.,

“Private sector key for treating HIV patients”

,
,CHENNAI: The participation of the private healthcare sector in treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) is extremely crucial for the State to progress towards its goal of no new infections, V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health, said.,While Tamil Nadu has been touted as a model for the rest of the country in HIV prevention, much of the success has been achieved thanks to fruitful partnerships with a number of international agencies, including CDC Atlanta, UNICEF, USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Population Services International, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and UNDP, among others.,
,
,The partnerships have been so successful that international agencies are happy to come to Tamil Nadu, he said. However, Mr. Subburaj said, in the event that international funding shrinks, it is necessary to have adequate internal private participation to sustain prevention efforts. One of the key areas that public-private partnership is required is in dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At a session on ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals — Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K. Krishnamoorthy, convenor, Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, said the gap caused by the 5As — accessibility, affordability, availability, acceptability and accountability — could be addressed with good PPPs. Setting the context for the event, Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project, said the State had come a long way since 1986 when the first cases were detected, but it was true that positive people were still being shunned at hospitals and positive children were being thrown out from schools.,Studies showed that 2.3 per cent of PLHAs complain that doctors and medical staff in the private sector refuse to even touch them in case their positive status is revealed. 89 per cent of positive people employed in the private sector fear that their jobs would be terminated if it got out that they were infected with HIV. “While we have covered the high-risk groups comprehensively, obviously we need to use mass media to approach the entire community with our messages,” he said.,Andrew Simkin, U.S. Consul-General, concurred and added that a lot remains to be done with regard to social attitudes towards HIV. America’s approach to visas has also evolved dramatically, as legislations have enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K. Rajan, Advisor — Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, suggested that all hospitals with 50 beds or more allocate at least five beds for the care of HIV positive people."

The five-year programme ended in July 2009 and the children living with HIV were left in the lurch. However, based on an appeal from the kendra, the Clinton foundation extended the programme for one more year and provided funds through Citizens Alliance for Rural Development and Training Service (CARDS). This programme would end in July 2010, she said.,Of the 65 children living with HIV in the kendra, 14 aged between 4 and 12, are orphans. The rest have parents and are getting treatment in the kendra under the National Antiretroviral Therapy Programme.,She said the kendra received Rs. 100 for a child from the foundation through ODP to provide food. When the financial aid was stopped in July, the kendra started looking for other donors. “However, obliging to our appeal, the foundation extended the programme by one more year,” she added. There were 75 registered HIV positive children in the district. Though the number of such children was more, it was difficult to identify them in view of the stigma attached to the disease, she said. As the programme would end in six months, the kendra had appealed to donors to make arrangements to support the 14 children. A committee had been formed for the purpose, she said.,Meanwhile, Nagaraj, District AIDS Prevention Programme Nodal Officer, said that free treatment was being provided to the 14 children and it would continue."

HIV+ children getting more attention: U.N. report

Interventions such as combination prevention efforts with young people, early infant diagnosis and Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) for PMTCT are now an integral part of the global HIV response.,In terms of results, the report suggests there has been a substantial increase in access to PMTCT in India. In 2008, in low-and middle-income countries, 45 per cent of HIV positive pregnant women received antiretroviral drugs to prevent PMTCT. That represents an increase from 35 per cent in 2007 — and from just 10 per cent in 2004.,“We need to focus on harmonising actions within maternal, newborn and child-health services and making community-based interventions integral to national scale-up plans,” the report says.,In India, as of September 2009, approximately 6,437 centres provided PPTCT services. Under the PPTCT programme, almost 37 lakh pregnant women were counselled and tested. India reported 10,673 women as receiving ARV prophylaxis in 2008 out of an estimated 49,000 positive pregnant women.,To be effective, paediatric HIV care and treatment need to become an integral part of infant and child survival, and health programmes. Lack of follow-up on mothers and children after birth represents both avoidable child death and a massive loss of investment as children identified as in need and who have been referred to services do not access them, the report says.,The National AIDS Control Organisation in India is planning to roll out the early infant diagnosis by 2010 in 700 integrated counselling and testing centres across the country.,The current economic crisis is likely to worsen poverty in households, which in turn, negatively affects children’s well-being, reducing households’ ability to cope with additional stress. Child-sensitive social protection is a key intervention to reaching affected children. It can help poor households cope and reduce the risk of chronic poverty, which drives children into orphanages, can prevent hazardous child labour and other forms of abuse, as well as supporting greater access to health and education.,In India, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is rolling out an Integrated Child Protection Scheme aimed at creating a system to promote the best interests of a child and prevent violations of his/ her rights."

From 2007 to October 2009, the Law Ministry released four drafts, each omitting several critical provisions aimed at promoting and protecting the rights of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.,
,
,The journey of the HIV/AIDS Bill has been extremely long, characterised by the disappointing drafts, and public protests against various versions of the Bill that diluted its objectives and spirit, Daisy David of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+), told at a press conference here.,It was disheartening to see the Bill shuttling between the two ministries for the past three years. “We need this Bill to fight discrimination against people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS,” she said.,It contains special provisions to address the vulnerabilities of women and children to HIV, according to Manjula K. of Action Aid. “The Bill entitles a survivor of sexual assault, even if it occurs within marriage, to access HIV-related counselling and preventive treatment.”,Pradeep Dutta of the Nai Umang Network of Positive People said passing the law would make it easier for HIV positive people to access treatment. The Bill also provides legal immunity to the provider and the receiver of services under targeted intervention programmes like condom promotion among sex workers and distribution of clean needles to drug users. Now, organisations engaged in risk-reduction programmes faced harassment from the police and other public authorities as these were considered an abetment to sex work and drug use, Mr. Dutta said.,Sudha Jha from Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India (SAATHII), Kolkata, said the targeted intervention programmes proved successful in controlling the spread of the epidemic. “The Bill provides a much needed fillip to these ongoing risk reduction services.”,Joe Thomas of AIDS-INDIA said: “In light of the routine rights violations faced by people living with HIV/AIDS, the tabling and passing of this Bill is extremely important.

World AIDS Day: another customary event passes

,TIRUPATI: As usual, the ubiquitous Red Ribbon made its presence felt across the district on ‘World AIDS Day’, which was observed in the form of awareness rallies, public meetings and quiz competitions.,The flurry of activities reached a sluggish pace by midday and came to a grinding halt by the lunch session and there was hardly any event in the evening reminiscent of forenoon’s message. Yet another customary event passed with the slogan-shouting medicos and placard-holding NGO members listening to the sermons given by the elite of the town on ‘keeping away from vices’.,The message for the year ‘Universal access to human rights – prevention, care and support’ still appears a far cry. While the general awareness on HIV/AIDS has increased to an appreciable level, the number of infection cases, on the contrary, is still on the rise. Piling of equipment to treat patients does not appear to be match with the quality of counselling provided. Stigma and differential treatment are still present, though in subtle forms viz., poor accessibility to general healthcare, non-integration of HIV with general healthcare and the absence of a comprehensive palliative care policy for HIV.,
,
,The recent death of a woman at SV Ramnarain Ruia Government General Hospital (SVRRGGH) mirrors the state of apathy. The destitute woman, apparently a HIV positive widow, was reportedly found dead at the entrance of the out-patient wing, with no medical professional or sanitary worker coming to her rescue. The OP bills as well as the Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) drugs in her possession might have indicated her ‘HIV status’ to the passers-by, forcing them to turn their eyes away.,“There is no dignity even in death. Our members rushed to the spot to help her, only to find her dead by then”, says R. Meera, secretary of Women’s Initiative (WINS), a voluntary organisation working for the welfare of HIV positive and sex workers.,She scowls at the level of indifference among the doctors who confine to testing and ignore the more-important aspect, counselling, to help the unsuspecting victims.,Looking beyond awareness rallies and lectures, the policy-makers are expected to take steps to remove the stigma.,
,
,Nellore Staff Reporter adds: Officials, students, Medical and Health Department staff and the political leaders took out a rally to enlighten public on prevention of AIDS.,Zilla Parishad Chairman Kakani Goverdhan Reddy, MLAs Mungamuri Sridharkrishna Reddy and Anam Vivekananda Reddy, Mayor N.

,Kozhikode: The shortage of beds at the ward for AIDS patients at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and the lack of government initiative to rehabilitate these patients continue to cause hardships for ‘Persons Living With HIV/AIDS’ (PLWHA) in the district.,Patients complain that though December 1 is remembered as World Aids Day, little is done by the government or society to understand their living conditions, with focus being given to disease awareness, prevention and control.,Government organisations offering services to the PLWHA community exist like ‘Jyothis’ which conducts free HIV tests; ‘Ushus’ also known as Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre where ART drugs are distributed; ‘Sneha’ to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy; ‘Pulari’ - a treatment centre for sexually transmitted diseases; and Prathyasha - a service agency serving as peer counselling centre.,However, activists working with AIDS patients say that a number of components are missing in the government’s AIDS policy. A government initiative to help these patients by providing free rations and find jobs and a rehabilitation centre for patients thrown out of homes to stay permanently are some of the demands that, they say, have been continuously placed before lawmakers.,P. Kumar, vice-president of the Council of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Kerala (CPK+) and a volunteer at the Kozhikode Medical College ward and the ART Centre, said improvements had been made in availability of treatment and distribution of medicines.,“But the lack of permanent doctors at the ward and the relegation of these patients from ward 26, which could house 40 patients, to ward 43 which has just eight beds have affected treatment facilities,” Mr.Kumar said.,Prathyasha counsels more than 275 AIDS patients, most of whom are destitute. They approach the staff at the centre with requests for money, food and jobs besides counselling but the government only foots the rent bill and the salary for the staff.,The centre helps them through food kits sponsored by NGOs like the Centre for Overall Development, Thamarassery.,Mr. Kumar said there could be more HIV patients in north Kerala beyond the 3,000 registered at the ART centre. Many keep the knowledge of the illness secret for fear of ostracisation, some are ignorant that they carry the illness while others are affluent enough to seek treatment at private hospitals.,“Most AIDS patients live lonely, fearful lives. Coming to a centre like Prathyasha opens them to others who face the same problems, yet get emotional and physical support to lead normal lives. The government should launch more outreach services for HIV affected persons through Prathyasha centres,” Mr. Kumar said."

The rate of infection in the State was 0.26, which was below the national average.,However, this did not mean that the State could afford to be complacent and all awareness generation and prevention activities should be strengthened, especially among the high-risk groups, to sustain the State’s good record, Ms. Sreemathy said.,She said that provision of safe blood for transfusion was one of the priority areas for the KSACS, and the government proposed to open more blood storage centres in the State. She said within the next two years, all community health centres in the State, especially those handling deliveries, would be equipped with blood storage centres.,Ms. Sreemathy said an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre would be opened in Kasaragod.

,MYSORE: If 22-year-old Seema (name changed) is today a picture of confidence and hope, then kudos to counsellors and doctors at Asha Kirana. Seema after being in and out of government and private hospitals and after wrongly being diagnosed with malaria and typhoid came to Asha Kirana.,There, it was confirmed that she was HIV positive and had tuberculosis. Over the past 20 days, Seema has shown signs of recovery thanks to the medicines and care by the staff and her mother.,“Only my daughter and I know about positive status. If we tell our relatives or people in our village they may ostracise us, as they are not aware of the fact that the disease won’t spread through contact or communication boycott. We’ll just tell them that she has TB,” says Seema’s mother.,What makes matters worse is that Seema has been deserted by her husband. After two miscarriages, her husband left home. “I was married off when I was 12 to my mother’s brother. My father felt that he was dying and wanted to see me settled. My husband was very fond of me, but now…” says Seema wiping away tears. Her mother now suspects that her brother knew that he was positive, but hid it from them. “He worked in Kalasipalya in Bangalore as a daily wage earner and he probably had physical relationships with women there. My daughter is suffering on account of his misdeeds. HIV/AIDS is not something that the poor should get; it’s among the biggest curses on the poor,” she says.,One relief, she continues, is that it is not too late still. “We did find out at the right time and there is still hope of recovery. Asha Kirana has offered to get her remarried or even get her placed with some company. Awareness about the disease and access to care becomes crucial in such cases and we wish many more initiatives are launched. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS should be removed,” says Seema’s mother.,Going by this incident , this year’s theme for World AIDS Day, “Universal Access and Human Rights”, cannot be more apt.,Says Dr. Mothi of Asha Kirana: “WHO had devised a 3/5 plan, according to which 3 million people with HIV/AIDS were to have had universal access by the end of 2005. But despite the availability of money, medicines and manpower this could not be achieved because of lack of awareness. So through this campaign we will all have to work towards creating a comfortable atmosphere where people can come and access care; bringing attitudinal change becomes important.”,Originating as a counselling-cum-care clinic for people living with AIDS (PLWA) in 1997, Asha Kirana has now evolved into a major referral centre in the State. Asha Kirana is the first specialised hospital-cum-research institute for HIV/AIDS, the first to offer subsidised HIV testing and free antiretroviral therapy to children with AIDS, the first voluntary counselling centre, the first healthcare facility to launch outreach programmes in rural and urban areas and the first day-care clinic for PLWA in Mysore region."

Improved infrastructure for ART centres and installation of new CD4 machines is also on the cards, participants at the meeting organised by TANSACS said on Tuesday.,Earlier, on Tuesday, at a meeting organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health, said the participation of the private healthcare sector in treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS was extremely crucial for the State to progress towards its goal of no new infections.,While Tamil Nadu was being touted as a model for the rest of the country in HIV prevention, much of the success was achieved thanks to fruitful partnerships with a number of international agencies, including CDC Atlanta, UNICEF, USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Population Services International, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and UNDP among others. One of the key areas that public-private-partnership (PPP) is required is in the area of dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At the session, ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way,’ Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals – Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K. Krishnamoorthy, convenor, Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, said the gap caused by the 5As – accessibility, affordability, availability, acceptability and accountability- could be addressed with good public private partnerships.,Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project (APAC), said the State had come a long way since 1986 when the first cases were detected, but it was true that positive people were still being shunned at hospitals and positive children thrown out from schools.,Andrew Simkin, United States Consul General, concurred and added that a lot remained to be done with regard to social attitudes to HIV. America’s approach to visas had also evolved dramatically, as legislation had enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K.

Vijayalakshmi, president of the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS.,Since most of the HIV affected people are shunned by their families and the society, economic emancipation through income generation activities was the purpose behind formation of the SHGs, under the Global Fund Round 4 Access to Care and Treatment (ACT) Project, according to Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,Each group constitutes 12 members and is not an SHG in the real sense of the term. In this case, the members are not required to make any monetary contribution for sustaining membership. The idea is to create a base for seeking the support of the government departments in the form of skills training and self-employment support.,At a recent convention, the members of the network pleaded for their inclusion for the skill- training programmes and self-employment assistance under the schemes of Social Welfare Department, Mahalir Thittam and Thadco.,They have enough reasons to feel that they are cared for by the government machinery. The support of the district administration in expediting the process of widow pension for the HIV affected women has been a cause for immense relief for the network members. HIV patients are also being provided with excellent treatment at the Annal Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital.,“Our concern is that the wrong notion of HIV affliction still persists among the people despite the fact that several widows among the HIV affected members were innocent victims. What we now look for is long-term support through exclusive government schemes directed at economic progress of HIV affected people,” said Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,
,
,To begin with, measures like issue of free house pattas to HIV affected people, priority in issuance of the various certificates, distribution of educational materials to children, marketing support for products developed by them, and inclusion of HIV/AIDS patients under the Chief Minister’s Insurance Scheme for Life Saving Procedures will go a long way in infusing confidence, according to the members of the network, which has been mobilising resources through sponsors to meet the educational expenses of the younger generation."

While welcoming the State’s move, members of positive networks are wondering if this will act as the much-needed bridge between ghettoisation and inclusion.,The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, along with AIDS Prevention and Control Project, Voluntary Health Services and Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative, is implementing a comprehensive master health check-up scheme for the high-risk group. The core group consists of female sex workers, men having sex with men and transgenders and will cover about 85,000 people and their families in the State.,“Providing comprehensive care is a step towards reducing stigma and discrimination within the hospital set-up because positive people usually tend to go to sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics only. This is to say we care for them and to ensure that they get care across all departments,” says V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health. The programme also anticipates upgrading of STI clinics within the government set-up and also training of staff in government hospitals, including nurses, counsellors, lab technicians and non-governmental organisation staff who will serve as a bridge between hospitals and positive persons. The services will be provided free and available under one roof. The drugs, thereafter, will be provided by the National AIDS Control Organisation, according to S.Vijayakumar, project director, TANSACS.,Rama Pandian, founder, Tamil Nadu Network of Positive Persons, brings up the issue of mainstreaming again. “No doubt this is a good initiative, and has received wide acceptance among the positive community.

Prasada Sarma,VISAKHAPATNAM: Notwithstanding several reach out programmes being implemented by the government and non-governmental organisations some key support components are missing out of the help being extended to people living with HIV (PLHIV).,It’s possible to live longer with HIV/AIDS with nutritional support and a life compatible with the limitations that HIV/AIDS imposes. The death of 300 to 400 people in the district every year due to HIV/AIDS underlines the necessity of more support.,President of Visakha Network of Positive People J. Srinivasa Rao has been living with HIV/AIDS for the last 16 years. Leading the network of 4,410 people, he takes nutritional diet, does yoga and stays away from smoking and drinking. “I read books and think positive and concentrate on living without losing heart,” he says. Into the second line of Anti Retroviral Therapy for two years, he regrets that many are succumbing for lack of support. While HIV/AIDS takes its toll on the individual, it makes PLHIV vulnerable to several health problems.,Even as they take drugs under ART, many suffer from poor haemoglobin count. “If their blood is transfused, they can improve their condition,” says Mr. Srinivasa Rao. The four-year-old Visakha network, operating with the assistance of Chennai-based India Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS organises regular counselling at the drop-in centre of AP State AIDS Control Society. The network is also helping those living with HIV/AIDS come together and marry. So far 11 marriages have been performed, some of them among educated professionals.,
,
,There is a proposal to give a pension of Rs.200 a month to PLHIV to help improve their nutritional needs. Many of the BPL families have white ration cards on which limited rice is given. AMG International provides monthly rations to 100 persons.,But PLHIV are still reluctant to go to the MRO office for the pension, says Additional DM&HO (AIDS and Leprosy) P. Rajendra Prasad. Hence it is proposed that the pension be given at the ART centres where they come regularly for medicines. The AP State AIDS Control Society is also urging the government to give the pensions at ART centres. Of the 3,600 undergoing ART, 233 are not regularly turning up for medicines. Also free blood transfusion is offered to PLHIV at all blood banks. But only 10 to 15 avail themselves of the offer a year, he admits."

The films ‘Life…,’ ‘Love…’ and ‘Hope…,’ made by Kiruthiga Udayanidhi, and directors M.Sasikumar and Mysskin reflect the social isolation of HIV-affected children. People AIDS Initiative, in association with Alaihal Midea and Red Giant Movies had produced the films.,Describing the discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS as “new untouchability,” actor Kamal Haasan said filmmakers have a major role to sensitise the society to the need for social acceptance of such people. On his association with the Population Services International and Hello FM initiative ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya?,’ a month-long campaign in support of HIV-positive children, Mr. Haasan said he would bear the medical expenses of 1,000 out of the 2,500 children to be adopted during the campaign.,Talking to the The Hindu on his attempts to make a feature film on AIDS, he said it was difficult to convince filmmakers to work on the project. “I wanted to make the film a decade ago when there was a lot of mockery and resistance. It is time we, along with government, act before the situation turns similar to Africa,” he said. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS was a major barrier to encourage public participation for the cause. “Rural population, in fact, seems to have a better awareness than urban people as a lot of awareness activities are happening in villages. But yet, people are not ready for a complete acceptance.”,The ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya? initiative will embolden more corporates, including insurance companies, and NGOs to come forward to support children with HIV. Expressing confidence that awareness films would do well commercially, Mr.Kamal Haasan said the economically backward, who contribute a lot to the success of a film, are the ones who are patronising films with social messages. “We must understand AIDS and do something about it rather than isolating the victims and shying away from the issue,” Mr.Haasan said.,Deputy Chief Minister M.K.Stalin launched the DVDs and Kiruthiga Udayanidhi Stalin spoke on the making of the film.,Presiding over the event, Mayor M.Subramanian urged theatre owners to come forward to screen the short films and create awareness among people.,Directors Mysskin and Sasi Kumar spoke on growing sensitivity among people to AIDS and contribution of films towards sensitising people.,A book, published by Arumbu Publication, on HIV/AIDS was released on the occasion.

College for Women and Arun Hospital and Nursing College on the theme, `Universal Access and Human Rights’ in connection with World AIDS Day at the Arun Hospital here on Tuesday.,Mr. Sekar said that the colleges should take up a comprehensive programme in the adopted villages in such a way that they not only create awareness of the disease but also ensure that those having symptoms of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection approach the doctor and follow it up with treatment and control measures. The students should also propagate the message that the infection does not spread through mingling with the infected persons, such as eating along with them or drinking water in the same tumbler in which the infected persons drank water.,Mr. Sekar said that each inmate of the Central Prison, Vellore is subjected to HIV test in the Integrated Testing and Counselling Centre (ICTC) functioning there since April 2008, immediately on his admission to the prison. A special medical team from the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital visited the prison every Thursday and provided treatment to the infected persons.,Raja Sivanandam, Deputy Director of Medical Services (TB) stressed the need for care and support to the AIDS-affected persons since the disease mostly affected the low-income category people. When such people are infected, it leads to their inability to work, leading to their economic backwardness. One should know that AIDS is not a killer disease, but only a lifestyle disease such as blood pressure or diabetes, which are preventable and treatable, but not curable. One’s longevity does not get diminished by the HIV. Death occurs only due to opportunistic infections such as TB. A person not having TB has only 10% chance of getting HIV, whereas a person infected with TB has a 60% chance of getting HIV. AIDS could be tackled only through a multi-pronged approach, with greater commitment on the part of the stakeholders, which includes the members of the community, people living with HIV/AIDS, the medical fraternity, the government and non-governmental organisations, he said.,K.S.T. Suresh, DDHS, Vellore said that ICTCs are functioning in 30 centres in Vellore district, including the government hospitals and primary health centres. In Vellore district, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres are functioning in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital and the Christian Medical College Hospital, while a sub-ART centre is functioning in the Primary Health Centre in Thimiri. About 30,000 child deliveries are taking place in Vellore district every year. Out of the 30,000 mothers who deliver children, 28,000 are tested for the HIV. One hundred percent coverage of the pregnant mothers would he achieved before the end of the year. The ICTCs also have the facilities for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive tract infection, which might also lead to HIV, he said.,
,
,V.S. Vijay, Managing Director, Arun Hospital said that the development of a vaccine against HIV was getting delayed in view of the fact that the HIV which is killed and injected into the body as a vaccine to produce antigens loses its antigenic quality once it is killed. After successful completion of vaccine trials with chimpanzee, human trials for HIV vaccine are currently in progress in the TB Research Centre in Chetpet in Tiruvannamalai district, with funds from the Indian Council for Medical Research, he said.,T. Sivakumar, Field Publicity Officer, Vellore said that the adult AIDS prevalence rate (persons above the age of 15 years) in India has been reduced from one per cent to 0.34 per cent ).,In 2008, 23 lakh people were living with HIV/AIDS in India, as against 334 lakh people in the whole world. Of these 23 lakh people in India, only one-tenth (2,17,781) were getting ART till March 2009. Twenty lakh people died of AIDS in 2008 throughout the world. A total of 4.30 lakh children were born with HIV in the world in 2008.,At present, there were 21 lakh children with HIV below the age of 15 years throughout the world, he said.,K.

A trilogy of films on HIV-positive persons

,CHENNAI: A short film trilogy shedding light on the social stigma and discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS was launched as part of the World AIDS Day here on Tuesday. The films ‘Life…,’ ‘Love…’ and ‘Hope…,’ made by Kiruthiga Udayanidhi, and directors M.Sasikumar and Mysskin reflect the social isolation of HIV-affected children. People AIDS Initiative, in association with Alaihal Midea and Red Giant Movies had produced the films.,Describing the discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS as “new untouchability,” actor Kamal Haasan said filmmakers have a major role to sensitise the society to the need for social acceptance of such people. On his association with the Population Services International and Hello FM initiative ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya?,’ a month-long campaign in support of HIV-positive children, Mr. Haasan said he would bear the medical expenses of 1,000 out of the 2,500 children to be adopted during the campaign.,Talking to the The Hindu on his attempts to make a feature film on AIDS, he said it was difficult to convince filmmakers to work on the project. “I wanted to make the film a decade ago when there was a lot of mockery and resistance. It is time we, along with government, act before the situation turns similar to Africa,” he said. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS was a major barrier to encourage public participation for the cause. “Rural population, in fact, seems to have a better awareness than urban people as a lot of awareness activities are happening in villages. But yet, people are not ready for a complete acceptance.”,The ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya? initiative will embolden more corporates, including insurance companies, and NGOs to come forward to support children with HIV. Expressing confidence that awareness films would do well commercially,,Mr.Kamal Haasan said the economically backward, who contribute a lot to the success of a film, are the ones who are patronising films with social messages.,“We must understand AIDS and do something about it rather than isolating the victims and shying away from the issue,” Mr.Haasan said.,Deputy Chief Minister M.K.Stalin launched the DVDs and Kiruthiga Udayanidhi Stalin spoke on the making of the film.,Presiding over the event, Mayor M.Subramanian urged theatre owners to come forward to screen the short films and create awareness among people.,Directors Mysskin and Sasi Kumar spoke on growing sensitivity among people to AIDS and contribution of films towards sensitising people.,A book, published by Arumbu Publication, on HIV/AIDS was released on the occasion.,The short films will also be screened in Coimbatore, Salem, Madurai, Tiruchi and Thanjavur."

,
,Besides, the focus on professional education would undermine science and social science education.,The Government maintained that professional courses ensured more employment opportunities, but the economic slowdown had exposed this myth as thousands had lost jobs both at home and abroad, despite having higher professional qualifications, he said. “Our society may not produce a C.V. Raman or Rabindranath Tagore if real education is ignored totally,” he added.,
,
,At present, 90 per cent of the money earmarked for education goes towards salaries. Hence, the Union Government should earmark a minimum of 10 per cent of the Union Budget towards education.,The State governments should enhance budgetary allocation to the sector from 15 per cent to 35 per cent. Instead of providing tax benefits to information technology and biotechnology companies, the Government should use taxes from them to improve the education sector, Mr. Rajashekhar said."

Ao asked his officials to gauge the level of resistance over accepting proactive step such as installing condom vending machines (CVM) and displaying information, education and communication material on hotel premises. “We can immediately launch very visible trial such as installing CVMs in places like Puri and Konark to assess the response of people,” said Mr. Ao. The tourism director impressed upon the tourist officers to elicit response of hoteliers and restaurant operators on HIV/AIDS prevention measures.

,JOHANNESBURG: Culminating his party’s momentous shift on AIDS, a disease that has led to plunging life expectancies here, President Jacob Zuma has definitively rejected his predecessor’s denial of the viral cause of AIDS and of the critical role of antiretroviral drugs in treating it.,Almost 10 years to the day after President Thabo Mbeki first suggested that AIDS drugs could pose “a danger to health” in an Oct. 28, 1999, speech in Parliament, Mr. Zuma declared in the same chamber, “Knowledge will help us to confront denialism and the stigma attached to the disease.”,In a country that now has more HIV-infected people and annual AIDS deaths than any other, Mr. Zuma’s clarion call for a battle against the disease, six months into his term as President, led to rejoicing among advocates who had long sought such national leadership.,Mr. Zuma said in his address: “All South Africans must know that they are at risk and must take informed decisions to reduce their vulnerability to infection or, if infected, to slow the advance of the disease. Most importantly, all South Africans need to know their HIV status, and be informed of the treatment options available to them.”,After Mr. Mbeki’s ouster from the presidency a year ago by his own party, the African National Congress, which has governed the country since 1994, a caretaker president appointed a new health minister, Barbara Hogan, who said in an interview that what she called “the era of denialism” was over.,Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, her successor as Health Minister under Mr. Zuma, has accepted the government’s responsibility for past failings and begun charting a more comprehensive approach to the AIDS crisis here.,Plain-spoken national leadership has proven critical to combating the disease in Uganda, Kenya and Botswana — and disastrous where it was lacking, as here in South Africa. Harvard researchers estimated that South Africa could have prevented 365,000 premature deaths if it had acted sooner to provide antiretroviral drugs to treat people with AIDS and to prevent HIV-positive women from infecting their newborns.,In his speech, Mr. Zuma laid out the horrifying toll of AIDS in South Africa.,Overall deaths registered in South Africa in 2008 jumped to 756,000 from 573,000 the year before.,The electoral commission had to remove 396,336 dead voters from the rolls in September 2008 and August 2009. Life expectancy for South African men is 51, compared with 70 in Algeria and 60 in Senegal, said Mr. Zuma.,“These are some of the chilling statistics that demonstrate the devastating impact that HIV and AIDS is having on our nation,” he said. “Not even the youngest are spared.” And though the country now has a strategy to fight the disease and the largest antiretroviral treatment program , he said: “We are not yet winning this battle. We must come to terms with this reality as South Africans.”,— © 2009 The New York Times News Service"

Dr. Surya Rao also presented a paper at the conference.,He said the conditions had changed a lot from 90s when an AIDS patient would die soon but now a patient could live 42 years more (from the time he or she contacted the disease) if he or she took the medicines. The concept worldwide on prevention of AIDS and HIV were based on policy of vaginal, oral interference control epidemic (VOICE) study, by taking a tablet or applying a gel and a mathematical model showed that by 2015, the world would be free of AIDS and HIV if one got treatment as soon as he or she contacted the disease.,There are medicines to control the dreaded disease but the high cost was proving to be a burden for people in the Asian and African countries while 85 per cent of the AIDS and HIV patients were living their life full.,Dr. Surya Rao also pointed out that many were not taking the full course of medicines and stopping medication as soon as they saw some improvement.,Circumcision would help a lot in preventing the spread of AIDS and HIV, according to studies made in this area, he said.

HIV prevalence decreases in the State

This is becoming true of Andhra Pradesh. For the first time the State has achieved remarkable gains in its fight against the HIV epidemic, arguably the most challenging of modern public health problems.,Though reversing the scourge remains a tough proposition, the State is able to arrest the malady in its track. For a change there is comfort in the cold statistics. The HIV prevalence rate today is now 0.85 per cent down from 1.22 per cent in 2008.,And the good news is it is going to further decline among the general population.,Also heartening is the rise of number of districts with less than 1 per cent HIV prevalence rate from eight in 2008 to 17 in 2010. However, Guntur, Kadapa, Karimnagar, Mahboobnagar, East and West Godavari continue to be high burden districts with the HIV prevalence being more than 1 per cent. In spite of the downward trend, there is no room for complacency as the State has high population of high risk group (HRG) in terms of female sex workers (FSWs), MSMs (men having sex with men) and the bridge populations - truckers and migrants.,Not long ago A.P was the epicentre of the HIV epidemic accounting for almost 21 per cent of the country's estimated burden of PLHA. What drives HIV transmission here is mostly unprotected sex. Targeted intervention of the HRG has paid off in checking this problem.,Saturated coverage of HRGs, scaling up of preventive services, community led structural intervention, linkage of positive HRGs with ART services have contributed in bringing down the prevalence rate. Another important factor is the widespread distribution of condoms – almost 7 million a month.,The condom utilisation has gone up tremendously among clients of FSWs.

,Prevention is better than cure. The A.P. State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) seem to set a great store by this maxim. Its primary focus is on prevention of HIV transmission among the HRGs. For this 138 targeted interventions are in operation covering about 2.50 lakh HRGs and bridge population.,The coverage for the targeted population has been streamlined with upscale and realignment of interventions based on revised mapping of HRGs.,“However, coverage of HRGs under TI is yet to be saturated in Telangana and Rayalseema districts. In coastal districts too there are pockets to be covered”, says R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, APSACS.,
,
,Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) are the backbone of preventive services.,As such the testing facilities have gone up from 677 in 2007 to 1180 in 2010. Likewise the Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres have increased from17 in 2006-07 to 43 now.,The number of PLHIVs availing the ART medicines every month has increased from 10,600 in 2007 to 79,949 now. So is the referral of positives from ICTCs to ART centres. So far 140 PLHIVs have availed the second line of treatment at the Centre of Excellence at Gandhi Medical College. To further promote the ART utilisation, the APSACS has proposed to provide free bus passes to persons visiting these centres."

APSACS to implement migration strategy to counter AIDS

In about a month's time the APSACS will implement the migration strategy in the State.,In migration, particularly from North East States, UP and Bihar is posing a big challenge.,With Andhra Pradesh becoming a high growth centre, opportunities have opened up especially in service sector and construction industry. Both skilled and semi skilled persons are heading here in droves and some bringing along the HIV virus. The greatest threat is from the single migrants who come to the State minus their families.,“We plan to create awareness about AIDS at the point of migration. The idea is to promote good health seeking behaviour among the migrants,” says R.V. Chandravadan, project director, APSACS.,Without being complacent at the declining HIV prevalence, he plans to intensify mainstreaming of HIV prevention efforts with all departments.,The APSACS is looking at a multi-sector intensified response since HIV has a cross cutting influence on all segments. A new innovative campaign is also underway with focus on prevention.,
,
,High risk groups like female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSMs), intravenous drug users (IDUs) and long distance truckers (LDTs) continue to be cause for concern. Targeted interventions are being planned on the basis of the scientific mapping of HRG carried out recently.,Close interaction with civil society and people living with and affected by HIV, it is believed, will help prevent new infections and produce measurable impacts.,While protecting the most affected persons, efforts are on to promote human and gender rights.,The strategy is to build on the gains and focus on the emerging areas of concern. “Sustained efforts coupled with innovative strategies will pay off,” says Mr. Chandravadan."

",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/Lack-of-kits-halts-HIV-tests-in-State/article16207943.ece,"Patients across the State are unable to get themselves tested for HIV/AIDS in government hospitals. Reason: unavailability of testing kits.,Testing has come to a halt in the past 10 days in all government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC), including Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore. A few centres that still have the kits are testing only emergency cases. This when the State testing centres need at least 4,000 kits a month.,“Many patients are upset. They shout at us and ask us if they have to use a politician's influence,” said V. Prakash, counsellor at Bowring Hospital's ICTC.,“There is shortage across the State. There are 565 ICTCs for the HIV-affected where they are tested for free,” said Fayaz Ahmed, an HIV/AIDS counsellor in an ICTC in Ramanagaram.,Testing kits are crucial because the calculated projection of the number of HIV-infected in the State this year is 2.75 lakh, say activists.,“Only about 1.4 lakh people have been tested at the ICTCs from 2002 till date. Many who suspect they have the disease come only reluctantly for testing. The shortage forces their being turned away, and 80 per cent never turn up again,” said an HIV activist.,“Each of the 565 centres has to test 500 cases every month and we were meeting at least half the target on an average. Now even that is not possible,” he said.,The shortage has badly hit the northern districts of Bijapur, Belgaum and Bagalkot. In the case of Mysore, people have been getting themselves tested in private hospitals for the past two months. Though the shortage has not affected private hospitals, many people in the poorer bracket cannot afford testing in these private laboratories.,M.B. Rudrappa, Joint Director of the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS), acknowledged the delay in supply of kits from NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) this month. “It is not an emergency or an epidemic. People can be asked to come back later,” he said.,But counsellors are sceptical as there has been a shortage on and off for the past two months."

Fighting AIDS through education
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/Fighting-AIDS-through-education/article16211718.ece,"Ramya Kannan,Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may have travelled a long way from the time myths and ill-formed notions about it fuelled a strong prejudice. But new myths keep surfacing every other day. What really drives the response to HIV/AIDS is a complex web of politically-motivated concerns.,It is this web that the Boler and Archer's book tries to map, highlighting the intricate network of political motivations that determine the way prevention, education, and support services are offered in countries hardest hit by the epidemic. And the authors do it pretty well, critically, without humming and hawing, and citing real-life situations in support. Here, then, is an open and honest book, from which nations will do well to draw lessons.,
,
,The authors are both with ActionAid. Tania Boler is a specialist in HIV and education who also did a stint with the United Nations. And David Archer is an acknowledged expert in international education. They put their heads and vast experience together to analyse how HIV prevention has “slipped down the international agenda and [how] meaningful attempts to tackle it are hampered by religious ideology and power struggles.”,“None of the children knew what AIDS was — but they knew it was bad.” Young Somchai (in Thailand) introduces the seldom noticed, but significant, component of discrimination at school. Orphaned because of AIDS, Somchai now has access to treatment, thanks to a local NGO, but is still not at school and has no idea that he is positive too. Where the lack of education co-exists with stigma, poverty and patriarchy, there seems to be little chance of making any headway.,
,
,However, the authors make it clear that, in the midst of all the HIV-wrought havoc and despair, education serves as a beacon of hope. The reasoning is simple: “Simply staying at school means that young children are in a better position to protect themselves from HIV.” Education has managed to provide African girls with the power to make sexual choices that prevent HIV infection.,From India, Africa, Thailand, and even the United Kingdom, voices speak of poverty, inadequate infrastructure, stigma, loneliness, want of political will, and, in some cases, genuine helplessness to face the onslaught of the HIV and the complex political whirl it unleashes.,South Africa's response to AIDS (under the leadership of Mbeki) comes under heavy fire. For a nation that, in 2007 had the most number of people with HIV infection, the government's response was obtuse, dilatory, and negligent.,The United States, under President George Bush, advocated abstinence and fidelity more than any other form of prevention. These messages inspired by religious right wing groups were spread across the world through PEPFAR funding. The authors, citing examples, show how they were — in several cases, based on inaccurate data — born out of fear, and caused serious damage to the condom promotion programme.,Boler and Archer refer to the huge funding the low and middle income countries get and argue that, if in spite of it, they have not responded well enough the reason is traceable to some basic problems in the way the assistance is provided. Sub-Saharan Africa, despite its heavy load, receives little international aid; and the money that comes is accompanied by conditionalities that are difficult to comply with.,
,
,There are, as must indeed be, positive stories too. In contrast to Somchai, there is Kwanjai, close to Chiang Mai, in Thailand; Brazil, where an active civil society and an early and serious investment in anti-retro virals helped tremendously with the country's response; and South Africa's Soul Buddyz, a highly popular national soap about HIV/AIDS that has made a difference to the youth;,Peppered right through with examples from real life situations, , has its readability enhanced by combining the story-telling mode and facts. To quote Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Boler and Archer “have given us a wonderful investigation of the ways and means of fighting the spread of AIDS through the expansion of education: better schooling, enhancement of public knowledge, and understanding of science.”"

HIV prevention campaign gets a boost
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/HIV-prevention-campaign-gets-a-boost/article16186533.ece,"Community mobilisation is one of the major components of the Targeted Intervention programme, visualised by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in its National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III).,Targeted Interventions (TIs) are HIV prevention and control programmes intended for specific groups which are at higher risk of exposure to HIV infection, like female sex workers or truckers or intravenous drug users.,The coverage, scale and quality of the TIs can be enhanced if these ‘at-risk' communities can be brought together to mobilise themselves as community-based organisations and encourage them to head these outfits. The idea is that the pro-active role of female sex workers as a Community Based Organisation (CBO) will certainly make them more responsive to the TI programmes and make them take up the responsibility of HIV prevention,However, mobilisation and empowerment of female sex workers is easily said than done. Many previous attempts to mobilise them into a well-functioning community group has been disappointing,However, the success story of ‘Santhwanatheeram', a community-based organisation of female sex workers, promoted by Jawahar Suraksha Project in Alappuzha, a TI project of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society, in getting together female sex workers and generating in them a sense of responsibility towards HIV prevention and control is an example worthy of replication .,Santhwanatheeram has initiated several programmes to bring together the female sex workers and encourage them to stand united as a community. But it was the process of election to choose the office-bearers of the organisation, which actually brought its members close together. The project utilised the election process as a strategy to mobilise the women and encourage them to come under an umbrella.,The women were encouraged to engage in a healthy competition and to stand for the general body elections. The process resulted in bringing more such women, who were hitherto remaining invisible, into the organisation.,Familiarising them with the democratic election process itself , including declaration of dates for nomination, withdrawal of nomination and canvassing the voters through direct or indirect interaction by candidates, release of election manifesto by panel of candidates etc. served as a capacity-building exercise. Besides, the women had opportunities for public speaking and a platform for leading advocacy.,The members of Santhwanatheeram today are committed workers for the TI projects of the KSACS. They participate in all regular HIV prevention campaigns and are totally committed to the cause they are promoting."

It will seek to focus on how laws and law enforcement can support, rather than block, effective HIV responses.,“Striking down of Section 377 has been a very important step in this direction and has generated lot of expectations and excitement among the people who are either affected by HIV or those with different sexual preferences,'' J. V. R. Prasada Rao, Member Secretary of the Commission told The Hindu here on Tuesday. Mr Rao, former Union Health Secretary, is at present Special Advisor to the Executive Director of UNAIDS for Asia-Pacific region.,“India's reforms in dealing with HIV, particularly decriminalising consensual same sex preference, access to medicines and even ending social discrimination will definitely be showcased at the global level,'' he said.,The Delhi High Court judgement was the first in India to directly guarantee rights for homosexuals. It overturned a 149-year-old British colonial law, which described sex between members of the same gender as an “unnatural offence.” While larger democracies like India have decriminalised same gender sex and USA and China have removed travel restrictions on HIV positive people, there is growing concern over new “restrictive” legislations on HIV being enacted in 15 countries, including Uganda and some countries in Africa. At present 52 countries have travel restrictions on HIV positive people. This includes India also. The Commission, announced last month, has an 18-month term and will submit its report in December 2011. It will pick up some of the most challenging legal and human rights issues in the context of HIV, including criminalisation of HIV transmission and behaviours and practices such as drug use, sex work and consensual adult same sex relations. “We will also take up women-related issues like marital rape, domestic violence and access to drugs and availability and patenting of generic drugs, though the focus will be on HIV,” Mr Rao said.,The Commission will have three meetings but will be supported by two inter-linked processes: regional hearings (to provide an interface between the Commission and stakeholders) and a Technical Advisory Group (to advise the Commission on key research and inform it on findings and recommendations). Purely an independent body, the Commission will have political leaders, and experts from the field of public health, academicians and judicial experts while the Technical Advisory Group will have AIDS activists including Mandeep Dhaliwal and Vivek Divan from India."

New therapy kills HIV-infected cells
",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/New-therapy-kills-HIV-infected-cells/article15786500.ece,"A new treatment that destroys HIV-infected human cells without damaging healthy ones has been developed by a team of Israeli researchers.,The therapy, developed by scientists from the university's Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences and the Institute of Chemistry, destroys cells infected with HIV without damaging adjacent healthy cells.,It is described in an article published last month in the scientific journal ,To date, no therapy has succeeded in completely destroying HIV-infected cells. Current treatments only delay the development of the disease and make it more manageable. If treatment is halted, however, or the virus develops immunity to the cocktail of drugs now used, it can begin infecting new cells.,The new treatment fights HIV by causing infected cells to self-destruct. When the AIDS virus infects a cell, its DNA penetrates the cell, which then manufactures new HIV viruses that infect neighbouring cells.,Dr. Abraham Loyter of HUJ explains that with the treatment, peptides, or segments of short proteins that the scientists developed, interfere with the HIV virus's replication of its genetic material, by transmitting a massive number of replications of the genetic material into the infected cell, triggering its self-destruction.,“The usual medications kill the virus that has entered the body during infection, and the [peptide] treatment allows cells infected with the genetic load of the virus to be killed,” Loyter said..,The study by Loyter, Prof. Assaf Friedler, Dr. Aviad Levin, and Dr. Zvi Hayouka, examined the effectiveness of the new treatment on the HIV-1 virus, which is the predominant cause of AIDS in developing nations.,
,
,When the treatment, which was patented earlier this year, was applied to human cell cultures, the infected human cells disappeared in two weeks, and did not reappear up to two weeks later.,Yissum, the HU technology transfer body, is seeking a commercial partner to continue developing the treatment through animal and clinical trials.,An estimated 33.4 million people worldwide are carriers of HIV, while in the U.S. alone, it is estimated that more than one million people are living with HIV, while another half a million have died of AIDS. In Israel, in 2008, 390 new cases were reported, the highest figure in a decade.,The current breakthrough joins other new therapies being developed to fight AIDS, such as a U.S.-funded study in Thailand of an AIDS vaccination, and a vaginal gel developed in South Africa that prevents replication of the virus and reduces the risk of infection by fifty four per cent.

Muthuchelian, Vice Chancellor, Salem Periyar University.,Inaugurating the awareness programme on ‘HIV AIDS - Safe Motherhood,' organised jointly by Youth Red Cross, Salem Periyar University and Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine Department, here on Thursday, the Vice Chancellor said that the objective could be achieved by health workers who could play an important role in educating people about HIV/AIDS.,“This may involve working with teachers, youth groups, women's groups and others, to help people to understand HIV better and find ways to encourage and support behaviour change.,“Improving women's status in society is also crucial - only then will women be able to negotiate with their partners for safer sex.,“The health and well being of women everywhere is of great importance in its own right. It is also a key to the health and well being of their families, communities and societies,” he further pointed out.,But every year, over half a million women in developing countries die in pregnancy and childbirth.,The Safe Motherhood Initiative was started in 1987 to improve maternity services and to protect the health of mothers and their infants.,“HIV presents an enormous challenge to safe motherhood,” he said and added that it was estimated that approximately two million HIV-positive women worldwide would give birth.,In several major towns in eastern and southern Africa, more than a quarter of pregnant women were now HIV positive.,
,
,“Women with HIV are more likely to have complications during pregnancy and delivery, or abortion. They are more vulnerable to anaemia, malaria, pneumonia, urinary infections, and tuberculosis (TB).,“For women with symptomatic HIV, pregnancy can also speed up the progress of their illness to AIDS. In South Africa, about one in eight maternal deaths are directly linked to HIV.”,“It is estimated that in Africa and Asia, more than two million children each year will lose their mother or both parents to AIDS. These children are in high risk group of poverty, neglect and early death.,“HIV can also pass from mother to child during pregnancy, labour and delivery, or through breastfeeding.,“It is not known exactly what proportion of babies born to HIV-positive mothers will be infected themselves, but without any kind of intervention, it is estimated that between 15 and 45 out of every 100 would be infected,” he said.,Around 5,70,000 children aged 14 or younger (most of them in sub-Saharan Africa) became HIV positive in 1999, almost all from mother-to-child transmission.,The prospects for infected children were not good. Children who were HIV positive were over 20 times more likely to die before the age of five than non-infected children.,A study in Rwanda found that even with frequent medical treatment, over a quarter of the children with HIV in the study had died before they were two years old, and over half died before their fifth birthday, he pointed out. ,YRC co-ordinator P. Thirumoorthi presided. The sessions were handled by a team of doctors including Dr. P.Gugapriya, Dr. H.Keerthana and Dr. Selvam.,Funded by UNICEF, it is being implemented for the first time in the country in Salem district.,College students in Salem district, approximately 70,000 will be given awareness in the Phase I programme who in turn make the general public aware under Phase II."

These were some of the issues of concern and the need of the hour was to take up behavioural change activities to tackle the problem, said R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society, here on Saturday.,Addressing a training session for media resource persons organised by the Centre for Advocacy and Research at Hotel Ilapuram, Mr. Chandravadan said that the scenario of HIV/AIDS spreading mainly through sex workers was changing and home-based sex was now the main contributor. HIV/AIDS could no longer be treated merely as health issue, as it became a social issue. This required multi-sectoral efforts to be intensified. Unprotected sex too continued to remain a challenge, he noted.,Addressing the 34th national seminar of the Indian Association for the Study of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS (IASSTD & AIDS) at The Gateway Hotel, Mr. Chandravadan said that the number of AIDS patients and sex workers in cities like Vijayawada and Guntur was high and any number of initiatives the government was taking was proving insufficient.,Pointing out that HIV/AIDS was posing a challenge to the field of medicine, he called upon the medical fraternity to take up this challenge and work relentlessly to control it. He felt that the government needed to augment its efforts, especially by releasing more funds.,Mr. Chandravadan expressed concern over disinclination of people affected by HIV as well as sex workers to approach doctors because of the social stigma. He admitted to have come across reports of government doctors looking down upon HIV patients and speaking to them in a contemptuous manner. This was forcing them to approach quacks and unqualified doctors. In some cases, non-availability of qualified physician too was a reason for patients to approach quacks, he said."

The experience of an aggressive anti-AIDS campaign in five cities in the United States was that counselling was more effective in checking the spread of AIDS than advertising and other means. This was because human beings play a very key role in the spread of the disease.

The family comes together to work out strategies to break the bad news.,This is a common dilemma almost every household faces today. Until the children are grown and not on anti-retroviral drugs, they face no worry or discrimination, but once the sexually active age is reached, things become difficult.,With the HIV infection having spread into the community, through the exchange or re-use of infected syringes and the unsafe sexual practices that have infected many women, now, the large number of children infected or affected by HIV poses a serious challenge to society as well as government.,Rough estimates suggest that Manipur has 6,500 children who are affected (orphaned or abandoned with their mothers by families due to the stigma attached with HIV) by the killer infection. Taking up the challenges, several non-governmental organisations have come forward to take care of these children by providing help with treatment and education.,The Manipur Network of Positive People (MNP +) started its education support to children infected and affected with HIV/AIDS in January last year. The initiative began with 44 children of Classes I to XII, who would otherwise have dropped out as their parents had little or no earning, besides having spent most of their savings on treatment.,Today, the programme supports 93 children and covers all nine districts in the State. Imphal West has 11, Imphal East 14. Bishnupur 15, Thoubal 10, Ukhrul 10, Senapati 10, Tamenglong 3, Chandel 10 and Churachandpur 10 such children enrolled in various schools.,The programme prioritises children who are infected and orphaned, infected and with a single parent, in addition to organising home visits to assess the beneficiaries. “MNP + intends to continue the support until such time that government education schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and others incorporate children affected by HIV and AIDS and are effectively implemented in the State,” Deepak, president of MNP + told ,. The MNP + has a tie-up with some local hospitals where these children are generally referred to. With awareness about the programme spreading, many individuals and philanthropic organisations have also started chipping in.,Another non-governmental organisation, Catholic Relief Service is providing education support to 210 affected children. Under the programme, children are provided Rs. 500 for admission, Rs. 700 for school uniform, textbooks and a set of exercise books, and a monthly school tuition fee of Rs. 100.,Even as the State and society struggle to rehabilitate children with HIV and AIDS, they are confronted with the yet other challenge of Hepatitis C, which has assumed epidemic proportions.,According to the Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment conducted by the ICMR and Family Health International in two Manipur districts — Bishnupur and Churachandpur — the prevalence of the Hepatitis C virus was alarmingly high among the injecting drug-users."

Insurance companies like Star though proactive to give policy to AIDS patients, their area of operations were very limited.,“At this point, I would like to question, when many diseases such as renal failure, kidney transplantations, heart attacks, strokes, cancers etc., have been included under insurance benefits, why AIDS patients are being discriminated against? Why are they not being covered under the super hit Arogyasri scheme'?”,Stating that it was violation of human rights of HIV/AIDS patients, he contended that the life of a person with kidney disease was not more precious than the life of a poor AIDS patient. This type of disparities and imbalances should not be a welcome feature in health sector, he pointed out.,At least the government machinery should not treat HIV/AIDS disease and AIDS patients in isolation as untouchables.,“Rather it is the responsibility of all of us in society to accept them as fellow human beings and give them an opportunity to live with dignity by getting regular ART and nutritious supplements to lead a near normal life,” he opined."

A unique course in HIV care

The anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres and community care centres for HIV patients are facing severe scarcity of doctors trained in HIV medicine.,With the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) increasing the number of community care centres and ART centres to meet the growing demand, the demand for qualified physicians has also gone up. And thanks to the rise in the number of HIV care and treatment centres in Karnataka, there is an urgent need for committed and competent physicians to manage them and ensure proper care of patients. Importantly, Karnataka is likely to have nearly 35 community care centres and 40 ART centres and the State plans to extend ART services to the level of primary health centres in a phased manner.,“HIV medicine was not a part of the curriculum at the time of training of most practising doctors. Moreover, there has been a steady progress in knowledge and practice in HIV care and treatment which required constant updating by the doctors. The opportunities for physicians to hone their knowledge and skills were limited in the absence of a detailed course in HIV medicine,” explains Dr. S. Rajendra Prasad, a senior physician trained in HIV medicine at the University of South Florida, U.S. and Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune.,Dr. Prasad says the shortage of doctors in HIV care is very high in the State and doctors are not familiar with the treatment procedures.,Taking all these factors into consideration and to address the challenges in HIV care, Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM), a voluntary social service organisation started by a group of medicos of Mysore Medical College in 1984, conceptualised the HIV fellowship course.,Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) has recognised the course and has introduced a 12-month residential course in HIV fellowship. The course, which has six-month compulsory internship, began in two institutions in the State with a maximum intake of 10 participants (for each institute) from July 1, 2009 onwards.

,RAJAHMUNDRY: The number of people who are HIV positive is increasing in Rajahmundry Central Jail, which is one of the oldest Central Prisons in the country, built in 1864. The number of positive cases has gone up from 45 to 54 in six months between 2009 August and March. “This number represents only officially tested cases. If we conduct blood test to all the prisoners the number may double or triple.,However the blood test is not binding,” said in-charge DIG and Jail Superintendent A.G. Sainatha Reddy.,When the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) asked a report on the number of HIV patients, psychiatric and other serious diseases, the jail authorities submitted the report and admitted that they failed in giving proper treatment to inmates and they were not in a position to control HIV deaths in prison.,The Right to Information Act throws light on health conditions of prisoners including lifers, non-lifers and under trails in Rajahmundry Central Jail.,The prison, which is having a capacity of accommodating 1,409 prisoners, is filled with 1,900 to 2,000 prisoners. Health screening of every prisoner is a must in accordance with NHRC's direction from many years.,In Rajahmundry prison there are 45 HIV positive cases, in which 25 are lifers, 11 non-lifers, 8 are under-trails. There is no confirmation from officials about how the dreaded disease was spreading in the prison.,From May 2007 to June this year about 20 people died in prison with different ailments including HIV.,Secondly, the number of psychiatric patients is significant. Among the 54 psychiatric patients 32 are lifers, 15 non-lifers and 7 under trails. “We are sending psychiatric patients to Visakhapatnam Psychiatric Hospital for treatment every month and after treatment they are coming back,” said the DIG.,The Rajahmundry Central Jail had violated all norms and directions of NHRC with regard to these patients. NHRC in its direction in the years 1996, 2000 under the chairmanship of Justice Ranganatha Mishra and Justice Varma has clearly instructed jail superintendents through DG's of jails that detention of psychiatric patients amounts to egregious violation of human rights and State governments cannot escape their obligation to provide proper psychiatric treatment to the mentally ill and such people are not to be kept in jail in any circumstance and they should not be treated as unwanted human beings, but put in hospitals."

,When the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) launched a major initiative about a year ago to mainstream HIV/AIDS care by seeking the collaboration and involvement of various ministries, government departments, corporate houses and business sector as well as people's representatives, it was not expected to be an overnight success.,The socio-economic aspect of HIV/AIDS cannot be easily conveyed to the people. Also issues such as combating the stigma associated with the disease and workplace issues are topics that require sensitive handling.,However, a year later, the Mainstreaming Division of the KSACS feels that it is on the right track in sensitising the corporate sector and attracting their resources to initiate workplace interventions. According to the KSACS, its pilot project with the Group of Techno Park Companies (G-TECH) has evoked such a positive response that it will now focus its efforts on wooing the corporate sector towards HIV prevention initiatives.,Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS care and getting a multi-sectoral response to HIV prevention and control programmes are the main objectives in the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP).,The core idea behind the mainstreaming effort is that the response to HIV can be effective only if it goes beyond the health sector and connects to people from various sectors.,The health initiatives aside, the idea is to get the government, the corporate sector and the civil society involved in fighting HIV. The KSACS's effort has been to get every department to respond to the challenge of HIV/AIDS by identifying how best they can integrate HIV prevention activities into their core business,The adoption of an HIV/AIDS Policy for its member companies by G-TECH is thus seen as a bold step and proclaims their commitment to inculcate awareness of HIV/AIDS at the deepest level among the member companies, their employees and their families.,The policy states that no employee will be discriminated against and that regular HIV awareness programmes would be taken up at all government-owned information technology parks in the State. The G-TECH companies have incorporated a module on HIV/AIDS in their staff induction training program and are organising voluntary blood donation on a regular basis.,They also are cooperating with the KSACS on various HIV-related initiatives.,The KSACS has been interacting with various government departments, including Social Welfare, Education, Labour, Police, Prison, Tourism and Local Self-Governance, with whom alliances could be forged to spread the message against HIV.,C.

,NEW DELHI: Creating a vaccine against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains one of the biggest challenges of modern science.,In the 27 years since HIV was discovered, scientists have learnt a great deal about the virus and how it causes AIDS. Making a vaccine to stop it, however, has proved a greater challenge than anyone could have imagined, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) has said in a statement issued here to mark World AIDS Vaccine Day.,“With 7,400 people newly infected with HIV every day, the best hope we have of ending this human catastrophe is to develop and widely distribute effective vaccines against the virus,” Seth Berkeley, CEO and founder of IAVI, said.,“Last September, a candidate vaccine regimen tested in a large clinical trial in Thailand protected volunteers from HIV with 30 per cent efficacy. That is not as protective as we would like a vaccine to be. Still, the result electrified the field: it was the first demonstration in humans that an AIDS vaccine is possible,” the statement said, adding that the challenge now was to build better vaccines.,“Weeks prior to the release of those results, researchers at and affiliated with the IAVI served up another advance: the discovery of two powerful new antibodies capable of neutralising a wide variety of HIV variants and the identification of the site on the virus to which they attach.,This site provides researchers with a promising new model to design a vaccine against AIDS.,“Subsequently, researchers affiliated with IAVI and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have discovered still more broadly neutralising antibodies to HIV,” the statement said.,‘Importance of testing',“The considerable work that lies ahead will include the continued clinical assessment of candidate AIDS vaccines. That the protective effect seen in the Thai trial was a surprise to most researchers was instructive, underscoring the vital importance of human testing.,“It is thus necessary to build and sustain sufficient human and infrastructure capacity to conduct the required research in such places like sub-Saharan Africa. Part of that effort will be the cultivation of international collaborations that engage the best researchers, companies, clinical research centres and technologies from around the world."

Ignorant of the advancement in the medical sciences in this area, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy, as they were sure that the child will be born with the virus. “Who would take care of an infected child after our death? Even my parents would reject the child. With this thought, we decided on the termination, until we met the outreach workers from PSI (Population Services International),” says Lakshmi.,The PSI representative talked about their ‘YRG-CARE Connect Project' on Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) and made the couple understand that through proper care and treatment of the mother the transmission can be prevented. PSI's Area Programme Manager G.K.V. Ravi Chandra informed that mother-to-child transmission of the virus has been categorised under the high risk groups along with other high risk groups like FSW (female sex workers), IDU (injecting drug users) and MSM (men having sex with men).,“The chances of transmission from an infected mother to a child are tagged under three instances: In the womb, during delivery and by breast feeding. Careful monitoring of the case, timely treatment and administration of Nevirapine to the mother before the labour pains and one dose to the new born immediately after birth can reduce the possibility by a huge margin. A mother is put under ART (antiretroviral) drugs during the pregnancy period if the CD4 count is less than 200,” informed Ravi Chandra.,PSI has tied up with St. Anns Hospital, Malkapuram, for its PPTCT programme and so far has treated 131 infected cases. “Only four out of 131 cases have tested positive. The prevalence rate has significantly dropped from 33 to 3 per cent,” said PSI's VCT/STI Manager K. Srikanth.,Unlike in earlier days when one had to wait for 18 months to assess the status of the virus in a new born, PSI has acquired the DNAPCR kit with support from HPCL. “With this we can detect the virus immediately after birth,” said Srikanth.,Lakshmi and Srinivas are among the fortunate to have a healthy baby and today it is one-year-old. “We know that we are reaching our end, but we are assured that our child is free of the virus and will be taken care of by our parents and family members after our death,” said Lakskmi."

The photographs capture the vulnerability and denial of rights that the children face every day.,

,As the media ethics demand that any representation of positive children should not be done without revealing their identity, the exhibition “Suffering Silence: Untold Story of Orphan HIV + Children” uses this challenge to use creative ways to tell the story and connect without compromising on the important message.,According to ActionAid, which is hosting the exhibition in association with British Council, India has a long way to go in ensuring the health and human rights of the poor and vulnerable. Poverty, gender inequalities, violence against women, trafficking, migration and disasters are all fuelling the epidemic.,While inadequate nutrition weakens the body, expensive medicines and poor government health systems make quality treatment out of reach for the majority, particularly in rural areas. Parents die in their prime and even orphaned children are not spared the stigma and discrimination that is often more vicious than the disease.,“Recent years have seen a disturbing trend of rising new infections in women, young people and children, pointing to the epidemic spreading to the general population and in rural areas,” said the non-government organisation.,The exhibition is on view till December 6."

Spotlight on migrant workers in the war on AIDS

This is especially true of Coimbatore district where a significant portion of its workforce is migrants.,A rapidly expanding industrial base _ and the consequent boom in jobs _ has attracted workers from far and wide to Coimbatore. Thus, the spotlight ought to be on these workers.,In the textile mills, about 50 per cent of workers are migrants. In engineering units, 40 to 50 per cent are from other districts and even other States. In the booming construction sector, migrant workers are employed in mega projects. Though there is no data, approximately 25 to 35 per cent of them are from outside.,“The main focus in the district now is migrant workers. We have to do much for them. Most of these workers are young. The risk of HIV/AIDS is higher if they are young (15 and 45 of age) and unmarried,” says Mohammed Ali, Programme Manager of District AIDS Prevention Control Unit. For the first time in the district, red ribbon clubs will be started at 30 industries on December 1. Each unit will receive Rs. 4,400 initially to create awareness and train peer leaders for awareness.,“We do workplace intervention for prevention. If workers test positive, they are given counselling and treatment.” Awareness is important for prevention, he says.,In an effort to assess the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among the migrant labour in Coimbatore, the Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research will embark on a survey on this section.,P. Ashok Kumar, Programme Manager, Targeted Intervention – Migrants Project, said that migrant workers at construction sites, factories, spinning mills and other industries would be tested for a HIV Sentinel Surveillance. Trained persons would visit the workers at their place, test a sample of five and send the report to the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University or the Christian Medical College, Vellore.,Mr. Kumar said this was the first time a survey would be done.,A maximum of 250 people would be tested across the district, starting January 2011. The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society had trained laboratory technicians for the purpose.,The Centre had identified 132 sites where migrant workers could be tested. However, samples would be lifted from only 50 centres. The target was single male between 15 and 45 years.,Mr. Kumar said in the Centre's assessment, migrant workers from Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are in workplaces in and around Coimbatore in groups ranging from 15 to 200.,The Centre is also engaged in creating awareness on HIV/AIDS among the workers in their mother tongue. “We have got multi-lingual volunteers.”,It also distributes pamphlets sourced from various State AIDS control societies.,A.S. Sankaranarayanan, Managing Trustee of Native Medicare Charitable Trust, said it organised industrial intervention programme from 2002-2008 in the district, covering one lakh workers in 72 industries. Apart from awareness programmes for workers, orientation sessions were organised for employees and for union leaders.,Industries voluntarily ask for HIV/AIDS awareness programmes and the Trust had covered about 30 units in Tirupur and Coimbatore districts, based on their request. Some units even installed condom vending machines on the premises.,Mr. Shankaranarayanan said that awareness was improving among workers. However, continuous education was a must.,The Trust developed an industrial policy that said workers with AIDS should not be discriminated against or should not be sent out of work. As many as 11 industries had signed the agreement.,According to M. Arumugam, general secretary of the Coimbatore District Mill Workers' Union affiliated to the AITUC, all workers in a factory should have basic amenities and access to healthcare.,The managements should organise awareness programmes on health-related issues regularly."

Prevalence of HIV attributed to illiteracy

He adds that once people come to know that they are HIV positive, they become introverts and refuse to talk about it in public. He underlines the need for initiating a discussion on the subject at the grassroots level so that its spread can be contained.,As per the Human Development Index report of Bijapur district, the number of HIV affected people in the district in 2005 was 2,887 of which 247 cases were from Basavan Bagewadi, 2,418 from Bijapur, 133 from Indi, 58 from Muddebihal and 30 from Sindagi taluk. Though Bagalkot district is a model in the country as far as Interventions for High Risk Groups are concerned, HIV prevalence among the general public is high. The early interventions in Bagalkot district in the form of India Canada Collaborative HIV AIDS project (ICHAP) and later by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) saw that the programmes for high risk groups saturated. The prevalence among sex workers has come down to six per cent in Mudhol and Jamakhandi taluks but the HIV prevalence among the bridge population is 41 percent and it is a little more than 50 per cent in the general population which is a cause for concern, according to experts.,Keeping this in view, the KSAPS had launched a door-to-door campaign in the month of August this year by involving actors and cricketers. Mr. Kittur says that he has taken the initiative to bring together sex workers in Bijapur district so that they can unitedly fight the spread of AIDS by way of becoming aware of safe sex practices and availing themselves of services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases."

,Madikeri: India is the home to the third largest number of HIV positive people in the world, characterised by widespread migration and mobility, it was revealed at a sensitisation programme on HIV, AIDS, involving migrant labour at a private plantation at Galibeedu, near here.,Organisers of a sensitisation programme, Asha Kirana and HOPES Trust, on Tuesday last called upon the plantation owners in Kodagu district to extend support to the programmes to generate awareness among the labour on the pernicious effects of the disease.,More than two million Indians did not live in the place of their birth. Migrants became vulnerable owing to several reasons such as dissociation from families, and sexual partners for long. It was important to note that all migrants were at equal risk, a statement received from Asha Kirana, Mysore, and HOPES Trust, Kodagu, said on Thursday.,One such programme called Targeted intervention project in Kodagu district was held at the private plantation. It was supported by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society, in association with the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), according to a statement from the organisers.,The statement said that there were over 2,000 coffee plantations in Kodagu and there were around 40,000 migrants in the district in the coffee season, of which 70 per cent would be men.,The sensitisation programme would help analyse the perceived HIV, AIDS risk management among migrant labour. Conducting awareness programmes through the media, community participation, street plays and other means such as information and education would go a long way in mitigating the impact of HIV, AIDS.,A positive network for HIV, AIDS did not exist in Kodagu, the statement said.,Women migrants were largely at risk due to the possibility of engaging in transactional sex either through coercion or to supplement their income. As far as men were concerned, relative freedom in a new setting as well as peer pressure to experiment with new norms or distress migration driven by seasonal droughts or disasters, loneliness, drudgery were some of the reasons. The lack of HIV, AIDS awareness, information and social support network were some of the reasons that exposed the migrant workers to risk.,Jnanamani Nanaiah, district AIDS nodal officer, who inaugurated the programme, highlighted the various modes of transmission of HIV, preventive measures and facilities available from the Government.,Swamy of Asha Kirana and Arathy Somaiah of HOPES Trust spoke."

Authorities informed that strict screening by a committee of experts would be taken up to identify patients who need this therapy.,There are 45,000 HIV positive persons receiving first line of HIV drugs in 25 ART centres since 2004 in the State. The second line treatment will be given to only those patients who are already registered in these ART centres and those who have a white card. “We are expecting 250 to 300 persons for second line treatment in the first phase. We are the third State in the country to implement this scheme. Initially, patients registered in Osmania and Gandhi Hospitals will be eligible for treatment,” said APSACS Project Director R. V. Chandravadan to media persons. Under second line of treatment, drugs worth Rs. 1 lakh per year to each patient would be supplied. Frequent tests to check for the effectiveness of the drugs would be taken up at Gandhi Hospital. Widows and children are also covered in this scheme.,“Patients who are on first line ART treatment since past two years at our ART centres but don’t have a white card are also eligible. The second line of drugs are ten times costlier than the earlier ones,” Mr. Chandravadan said. Second line regimen will have more side effects and tolerability of these drugs will be much less compared to first line drugs. “Patient has to take 7 to 9 pills per day in this regimen and have to ensure strict adherence to protocols because there is no treatment after this,” said Dr. B.

Most HIV+ widows live as outcasts

,CHANDIGARH: “The only thing worse than being HIV+ is being an HIV+ widow,” says 26-year-old Pooja Thakur, who lost her husband, a truck driver in Punjab, to AIDS five years ago. Pooja is one of the many widows in the State who are shunned by society once they contract HIV from their husbands.,Compared to the social stigma faced by such women, the medical complications of the disease look frivolous. Apart from being considered a “bad omen” at social functions, most such women are treated as outcasts by their own families.,“My in-laws blamed me for my husband’s death and threw me and my three sons, two of whom are HIV+, out on the street. Because of the social stigma, no one provides shelter or job to an HIV+ person and the females, especially young widows, usually fall prey to sexual abuse,” says Pooja who works as president of the Chandigarh Network of Positive People (CNP+).,While a few of these women manage to find some source of employment, usually as maids by hiding their disease, many fall prey to prostitution. “I lost my husband and I was denied my right over what he left behind. Worst, for no fault of mine, I too had HIV. At first I thought of committing suicide but there was no one to look after my children, so I left the village in Fazilka and went to Ludhiana, but poverty drove me to prostitution,” rues a 26-year-old mother of two whose husband contracted the disease by sharing infected needles.,According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, over 17 per cent of HIV/AIDS cases in Punjab are caused by sharing of infected needles, the national percentage for which is barely 3 per cent.,According to the CNP+ Programme Coordinator, “The national training module for prevention of transmission of HIV to children, 2002, is flawed because there is no consideration of the socio-economic variables of rural India. All efforts of the government agencies are focused at getting photos clicked and putting up a colourful exhibition followed by lunch and tea for the guests and VIPs.”,According to a senior official of the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, over 50,000 people visited the Red Ribbon Express, a special train run to create awareness among the masses about HIV/AIDS. The official added that the Government grants widows a pension and free education to all children irrespective of their HIV status. The pension received by a widow, HIV+ or not, is Rs.250 per month, which comes once in a few months, according to Meenaj Vij, who has been HIV+ for the past 14 years.,“Though the first few years are difficult, each widow learns to live for the sake of her children. A few lucky ones have a supportive family or a job, but even the unlucky ones carry on hoping for a better future for their children,” she adds."

In addition, she continues her field visits to collect details of people living with HIV and verify whether the beneficiaries of the loan scheme have been repaying their instalments promptly.,Another notable feature has been that the stigma attached to the disease seems to be on the wane, if the way the women freely walking into the house of Ms. Dakshayini to buy saris is any indication.,Lokesh, a tailor who is also HIV-affected, has purchased a sewing machine attached with a motor, and has been stitching garments as well as undertaking sub-contracts in the field. “With one sewing machine I purchased earlier, I was working on a temporary basis. After getting the second one, my wife has also been working with me. In addition, I undertake sub-contracts to stitch garments. The loan scheme has really helped me,” he says.,The two are among 124 beneficiaries of the scheme spread all over the district. In all, 274 HIV-affected people have applied for loans. Perhaps for the first time in the country, an organisation such as the BDAPS, which has been set up with the Deputy Commissioner as the ipso facto Chairman, to monitor the implementation of the Coordinated HIV/AIDS Response through Capacity Building (CHARCA) Project, sponsored by the UNDP, thought of economic empowerment of HIV-affected people and their families, by arranging for bank loans so that they could take up various employment avenues.,Bellary is the only district in the State, and among six in the country where the CHARCA programme was implemented due to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS. Under the programme, various activities relating to knowledge dissemination, education and communication were undertaken to improve the lifestyle of those affected.,Owing to the initiatives by then Deputy Commissioner Arvind Srivastav, the UNDP agreed to sanction a sum of Rs. 30 lakh for the scheme. Bankers were also persuaded to come forward to give a matching grant in the form of loans. The attitude of the bankers, who were initially apprehensive over lending to HIV-affected people on the ground that their life span was short, indirectly affected the launch of the scheme. Detailed discussions with them helped bring about a change in approach, after which the Pragathi Grameen Bank, the State Bank of Mysore and Syndicate Bank, agreed to extend loans (Rs. 30,000 for dairy activities, Rs. 24,000 for sheep rearing and Rs. 15,000 for business, mostly supporting existing skills) with a 50 per cent subsidy to be given by BDAPS.,“Twenty more applications from people living with HIV are ready for clearance and a subsidy amount of Rs. 1.86 lakh has been released. Soon, the loan amount will be disbursed,” Dr. Jayakumar, District Health Officer, told The Hindu."
