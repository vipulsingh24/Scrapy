,Anantapur: The group of 1,600 odd sex workers formed by the Centre For Rural Action (CERA) and sponsored by the Centre For Advocacy and Research (CFAR) in five mandals in the district had graduated into an assertive community now, fighting for their rights and tackling HIV/AIDS effectively.,Gone are the days when sex workers operated with a guilt conscience in a fearful environment under threat of police harassment, pressure of physical violence by men, poor health conditions and risk of AIDS virus looming large over their frail lives.,The story of the sex workers before 2004 was one of harassment, rejection, living in seclusion, poor health, insecurity and living as objects of pity but after the CFAR and the CERA stepped into the scene, the sex workers came together as a community, organised themselves into a responsible band of educators by joining the bandwagon of the Anti-AIDS campaign.,Important issues,While leaving moral issues to the individuals who are part of the game, the community got organised under the guidance of the advocacy group to attend to issues of vital importance including health of sex worker, future of their children, educating the police on the real issues of their life and practicing “safe sex” and making it mandatory for men to use condoms.,In 2004 only 15 per cent of male customers coming to them were using condoms while the vast majority were disinclined to use condoms but today 95 per cent of clients were using condoms, says Sudha Rani, the programme officer of CEFAR during an informal chat with “The Hindu”.,Awareness,The sex workers were first educated and motivated on the pros and cons of practicing unsafe sex. Exclusive medical clinics were opened for them in the five mandals of Kalluru, Tadipatri,, Garladinne, Peddavaduguru and Anantapur . Free medicines for HIV and even for veneral diseases were being given. A doctor to cure their problems and to educate about health problems without embarrassment and inhibitions were extended to the sex workers, be it male or female sex workers or transgenders . Holding of community meetings, discussing problems and representing the same with the concerned agencies at the highest-level and interacting with the station officers at the police station-level were in vogue since 2004.,Sex workers fully convinced of their social responsibility educated their clients and almost made sex conditional to put a halt to the spread of HIV/AIDS virus. Due to community approach violence, police harassment and other related problems had been minimised, says Naga Lakshmi, an outreach worker.,She says that minor girls were being prevented from entering into sex business and even new entrants were being counselled on the far reaching consequences of living the life of a sex worker. Rama Lakshmi, president of Jhansi Lakshmi community-based organisation said that the campaign against AIDS by sex workers themselves has paid rich dividends and today only 195 of the 1,600 odd sex workers were victims of the AIDS virus."

Prime aim was to prevent new infections and promote people who were vulnerable to HIV to voluntarily undergo testing and other services, he added.,In Dindigul, 1.03 lakh people were examined and 1,583 people who needed ART treatment were put on it to extend their life span.,Besides, 34,347 pregnant women underwent voluntary HIV testing this year of which 70 were found positive.,The positive cases were linked to Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission Programme that played a key role in preventing the HIV transmission from the mother to the child, said T. Jayabal, Joint Director of Health Services.,The Dillu Dura campaign was initiated by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS).,Twelve vans were on the move in 22 districts to provide people with information about various services and how they could be accessed.,The campaign team would go from village to village in the State in the next 35 days in two phases offering information about counselling and testing centres.,One team would cover one village, a college and one hot spot in a day.,TANSACS had plans to cover 600 villages along with 200 colleges and a few hotspots at villages.,In the first phase, the team would cover 12 districts in the next 13 days and in the second phase, 14 districts between March 14 and April 1.,At present, 27 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres at government headquarter hospitals and medical college hospitals provided these services."

,
,
,
,The Phase IV trial started in June 2006 to treat patients simultaneously for both TB and HIV has returned some important results. The trial once again reinforced the need to treat the afflicted for both the diseases simultaneously.,According to earlier guidelines, patients were to be treated for TB before treatment for AIDS could begin. Unfortunately 20 per cent of patients die in the first year, and another 20 per cent in the second year in the absence of AIDS treatment. This necessitated a change in the strategy — treat patients for AIDS even as TB treatment is under way.,
,
,This trial is proof that treating both the diseases at the same time is good for patients. The cure rate was 90 per cent when patients were treated for both the diseases. Compare this with the earlier strategy of treating only for TB, even when co-infected with HIV. The cure rate was at best 72 per cent. The low cure rate when treated only for TB was because many were dying or failing to respond to TB treatment.,“The lower cure rate [when only TB was treated] was probably due to progression of AIDS,” said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Senior Deputy Director (Division of HIV/TB), Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai. Dr. Swaminathan was the trial investigator. Apart from the cure rate, only five of the 119 patients in the trial died compared with 9-10 per cent mortality as reported in other studies when only TB was treated.,This trial provided the answers to some of the critical issues as well. It was earlier considered that TB symptoms would flare up when a person with TB was given antiretroviral therapy (ART) for AIDS.,Also, treating patients with Nevirapine (an AIDS drug) when already on Rifamycin, a TB drug, would be a problem. That is because Rifamycin induces some enzymes which in turn metabolise Nevirapine. Hence the level of Nevirapine in the blood drops, making it very favourable for HIV to mutate and develop drug resistance.,Apart from showing that it was indeed possible to treat for both the diseases simultaneously, the trial showed the safety and possibility of using Nevirapine even when the patient was on Rifamycin.,The trial had two arms (groups). One arm was given Efavirenz plus two other AIDS drugs and the other got Nevirapine and two other AIDS drugs. Both the arms got the TB drug, Rifamycin.,“Our study showed that it is indeed safe to give Nevirapine when on Rifamycin,” said Dr. Swaminathan. “Nevirapine also brought down the mortality.”,While the HIV viral load in both the arms saw a reduction to less than 400 copies per ml, the percentage of people who showed the reduction was as high as 85 in the case of the arm that got Efavirenz. It was 67 per cent in the arm that got Nevirapine.,
,
,The unexpected finding was that the cure rate was 84 per cent in the case of patients who got Nevirapine. The Efaviranz arm had cure rate of 95 per cent.,“The reason for the poor performance [in the case of Nevirapine arm] could most likely be drug interaction between Rifamycin and Nevirapine,” she said. Only 200 mg of Nevirapine is given during the first two weeks before increasing it to 400 mg. “The poor performance could be due to the suboptimal levels of Nevirapine in the blood during the first two weeks of treatment,” she said.,Despite the reduced efficacy, Nevirapine is the best bet in certain cases — pregnant women and psychiatric patients cannot be given Efaviranz."

AIDS vaccine prospects brighten,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/AIDS-vaccine-prospects-brighten/article16589039.ece'],)","The recent enrolment of the first volunteer at the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chennai for a Phase I prime-boost AIDS vaccine clinical trial to be conducted simultaneously at the centre and the National AIDS Research Institute in Pune marks a new beginning in the search for a real AIDS vaccine. Two vaccine trials were done earlier but this is quite different. A prime-boost strategy is primarily meant to enhance and prolong the immune response to the disease. In this case, Advax, a DNA candidate vaccine, will be used for priming the immune response and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) for boosting it. The MVA vaccine was tested recently during the Phase I AIDS vaccine trial at the TRC. While all the volunteers who received this vaccine produced an immune response, its level was modest and its persistence was not very encouraging. The significance of the new trial lies in the fact that priming the immune response prior to administering the MVA may help enhance the immune response. The MVA vaccine used in the trials was developed by the Kolkata-based National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases along with the trial sponsor, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI).,Unfortunately, while the trial has been registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India, the Indian government and the sponsor have not complied with clinical trial registration best practice. Although registration of trials is not mandatory yet, the registry run by the government recommends that registration be done prior to the enrolment of the first volunteer. This is also one of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation’s International Clinical Trial Registry Platform and the recently amended Declaration of Helsinki in the interest of introducing more transparency and accountability in clinical trials. In the present case, the commencement of the trial was announced in the first week of February, the first volunteer was enrolled on April 1, and registration was done only a week later. It is unfortunate that at a time when India is conducting a large number of trials, the government squandered an opportunity to set a benchmark for registering trials. The good news is that the two institutes where the Phase I prime-boost trial will be conducted have maintained high scientific and ethical standards and refused to buckle under any external pressure while doing the two earlier AIDS vaccine trials."

They say that though they are on free ART, the revenue from these coin boxes helps them meet the expenses they incur on the nutrition-rich food.,The study further says that 16 coin boxes, run by PLHAs, have erased the discrimination too. Among them are 19 women and of whom 14 are widows.Even after two years, 80 per cent of the boxes are ringing in a steady flow of money thus holding out a glimmer of hope to the victims.,`Salem Success’ has spurred the motivators to expand the project at national level."

,Diarrhoea kills 1.5 million young children a year in developing countries — more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined — but only four in 10 of those who need the oral rehydration solution that can prevent death for pennies get it.,“All the attention has gone to more glamorous diseases, but this basic thing has been left behind,” said Mickey Chopra, chief of health at UNICEF, which is trying to put diarrhoea back on the global health agenda. “It’s a forgotten disease.”,His observation lies at the heart of a wider debate over whether the United States and other rich nations spend too much on AIDS, which requires lifelong medications, compared with diarrhoea and the other leading killer of children, pneumonia, both of which can be treated inexpensively.,The debate is flaring at a time of great opportunity and risk. Recent data has documented remarkable progress in reducing child mortality and treating people with AIDS. Foreign assistance, which has often delivered disappointing results, is helping save millions of lives, the new figures show.,But as the United States and other rich nations hit by the global financial crisis face their own daunting challenges, there is heightened competition for foreign assistance. President Barack Obama has proposed a 2 per cent increase in HIV/AIDS spending for 2010 and a 6 per cent rise for maternal and child health, according to the Global Health Council, but the disparity in American spending on AIDS and the big child killers remains stark.,In Africa’s two most populous nations, Nigeria and Ethiopia, the number of people who died of AIDS in 2007 — 237,000 — was less than half the 540,000 children under 5 who died of pneumonia and diarrhoea. But this year, the $750 million the United States is spending on HIV/AIDS in the two countries not only dwarfs the $35 million it is spending there on maternal and child health, but is also more than the $646 million it is spending on maternal and child health in all the world’s countries combined.,“AIDS is still underfunded, no question,” said Jeremy Shiffman, a political scientist at Syracuse University who has documented global health spending patterns. “But maternal, newborn and child mortality is a tremendous tragedy and gets peanuts.”,Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel — a bioethicist, White House official and brother of Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff — has contended that international aid for health is limited and would save more lives if increases focused on maternal health and the “mundane but deadly diseases” that kill young children. Such choices are necessary, he and a co-author wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April, “if the United States is going to shoulder the burden of choosing which lives to save in the developing world.”,
,
,Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist, countered that wealthy donors still spent far too little on global health and rejected what he called the wrong-headed idea that “we need to make a terrible and tragic choice between AIDS or pneumonia.” The United States has invested heavily in the fight against AIDS, and other wealthy nations should pick up more of the cost of other global health priorities, he said. “Rather than tearing down what’s working, we should continue to invest in what’s needed,” he said.,Mr. Obama has promised to put greater focus on child and maternal health and proposed a 53 percent increase next year in money to fight malaria, a major killer of African children, the Global Health Council estimated. But he has also committed to major increases in money to fight AIDS in coming years that, if enacted, would ensure AIDS remained America’s global health priority, constituting over 70 per cent of its global health spending, he said.,International commitments to combat HIV and AIDS rose at an average annual rate of 48 per cent from 1998 to 2007, reaching $7.4 billion and making up almost half of donor financing for global health, according to Prof. Shiffman’s analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.,Still, more than half the people with the disease who need drug treatment still are not getting it. Two million died in 2007, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.,The toll of women and children who die of easily preventable or curable conditions is even higher. Pneumonia alone killed two million children under age 5, and diarrhoea 1.5 million more, out of the almost nine million young children who died last year.,Dr. Olivier Fontaine, who described himself as the only person at WHO working full time on childhood diarrhoeal diseases, said health ministry managers in poor countries know diarrhoea is a crucial cause of child mortality, but focus on other diseases that have gotten more attention and financing from abroad.,Two days after her month-old son’s bout of diarrhea began, Marcia Mankense, 23, took him to a hospital here in Johannesburg where a doctor administered fluids through an intravenous line threaded into his scalp. Before his birth, she said, no one told her she should give him oral rehydration salts — known as ORS — as soon as he got diarrhea, though she was counselled on the need to get tested for HIV. Nor did anyone give her a packet of the salts to take home.,“He’s my firstborn and I know nothing about kids,” she said, exhausted next to his crib after days of vigil. “I just feel like I need to be here for him. What if he’s crying?”,Public health experts agree there is tremendous potential to lower child deaths from diarrhoea and pneumonia substantially. New methods of distributing rehydration salts and cheap zinc tablets, also recommended for diarrhoea, are being tested, including giving them away during national campaigns to hand out antimalarial bed nets and to vaccinate children against measles.,
,
,“Everyone should have ORS at home like we have Band-aids,” Fontaine said.,For an extra $3 billion to $4 billion in coming years, children in poor countries could be inoculated against pneumonia and the rotavirus that causes about a third of diarrhoea deaths, according to the GAVI Alliance, a broad group of donors.,On the diarrhoea ward at the hospital in Johannesburg, most of the babies and young children had mothers patiently sitting next to their cribs, comforting them. But one little boy, 2 months old, was alone. His mother, a 10th grader, was at school. He had come in dehydrated, with sunken eyes, too enervated to even cry. But after being given fluids intravenously, life flowed back into him.,When he howled, a nurse or one of the mothers would look into his eyes. He would fall quiet, his cries muting to soft mewling, his eyes widening curiously.,“He wasn’t even crying when he got here,” Mankense said happily. “Now we can hear his voice. He’s naughty!”"

The ban has been in place for more than 20 years.

By the end of next month, the AIDS Research and Control Centre (ARCON) here will close its doors to 10,000 patients as the project timeline ends on April 30.,Global Fund, an international network of organisations, which aided the project, will not be renewing its grant to ARCON — an autonomous organisation of the government of Maharashtra, set up since 1994.,Initially it was funded by Texas University and later by Global Fund. The news of closure has landed them between the devil and the deep blue sea. They will either have to spend an interminable amount of time at government centres or an obscene amount of money for private care. The chances are even both put together will not provide the care and satisfaction they avow they get at ARCON.,Rupkar says: “Even after spending Rs. 25,000 per shot, the doctors at the hospital I went to told me that they were helpless and no further treatment was possible for my son. That is when I shifted to ARCON.”,Here, the staff treats patients like family. Medicines are not the only cure for HIV/AIDS. Counselling plays a major role. There are so many male patients, whose spouses have not contracted HIV/AIDS.,Over the years, the research at ARCON has resulted in 25 published articles and 15 books. The calibre of its staff receives instant endorsement from patients. They also commend the service and the humane approach to treatment.,Despite its good track record, project director Abhay Chowdhary has let ARCON die its own death. He made no effort to seek aid of any kind. He does not see the point. The medical care at the centre is not free. There is a graded pricing pattern where patients are slotted into four economic categories. The well-off pay and the poorest don’t. “We do not find patients who are willing to pay. So this model of graded pricing is not sustainable.”,He also sees no point in worrying over the patients. They can always go to the free NACO [National AIDS Control Organisation] centres, he proposes.,The patients are not amused.,Roy Mhatre (name changed), an ARCON patient since 2000, discards this solution right away. “Just see the condition of the government centres. At the JJ Hospital, I wait for three hours only for a blood test. An HIV/AIDS patient has to make three to four visits in a month. Do you expect a patient, in pain, to wait that long? Plus, if one has to stand in a line for that long when will one work?” he thunders.,By Maharashtra Higher and Technical Education Minister Rajesh Tope’s own admission, the NACO centres are crowded.,Dr. Chowdhary’s estimate of affected patients obfuscates the impact of the problem. “Only 372 who are on Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) will be affected. We do not have 10,000 patients.”"

Mann’s interview on the HIV/AIDS outbreak, which would leave behind millions of orphans, I thought that I could do something to reduce their sufferings.”,In 1989, she along with her family and friends founded the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud International (FXB International), in the name of her late son. “FXB offers support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The overall strategy of FXB is the practical implementation of the link between health and human rights in the daily lives of its 16 million beneficiaries across nations. Today, FXB counts more than 100 programmes in 18 countries, including 33 FXB-Villages,” says Albina.,She came to India 18 years ago. “Given its diverse cultural fabric, to start work on an issue still considered a taboo was not easy. Poverty, commercial sex work, migrant workers and the vast population of truckers contribute largely to the spread of the disease. If the governor of one state allowed me to start my work the other threw the spanner in my spokes. But despite all odds, we have been able to take the initiative under the FXB Suraksha programme and could establish five FXB villages in different states,” says she.,Appreciating the work done by the government’s in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, she points out that in many of the states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the survey has not been done properly to assess the scenario.,The FXB villages are located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh; Aizawl, Mizoram; Imphal, Manipur; Dhapa-Tangra, West Bengal; and Medinipur, West Bengal. Each village supports about 80 to 100 families by providing basic package, comprising healthcare, education, nutrition support and psychological support.,FXB Suraksha is also into counselling of pregnant women to stop the transmission of the virus from mother-to-child.

| Photo Credit: , ,Community participation is important to eradicate the dreaded pandemic called HIV/AIDS,Only a few in the world would garner the courage to turn their entire wealth for a social cause. And one among them is the multifaceted persona of Albina du Boisrouvray. It is not exaggeration to call her multifaceted, as she has been a model, an actress, a film producer, freelance journalist and now she has donned the role of a philanthropist. As a journalist she has the credit of bringing out a scoop on the circumstances surrounding the death of Che Guevara and her prized possession till date is the unfired bullet from Che’s M-16 rifle. She also founded a literary magazine ‘Libre’ that published the works of several Latin American writers, namely Plinio Mendoza, Carlos Franqui, Octavio Paz, Claribel Allegria, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes.,In a chat with The Hindu Metro Plus recently, the countess embarked on a journey to recollect her journalistic days and what made her sell her family fortune to back the children orphaned by the pandemic called HIV/AIDS.,On what made her turn to a social entrepreneur, she says, “My son was a helicopter rescue pilot and he died on a rescue mission in Mali. He was then only 24 years old and was dedicated to the service of mankind. To give a fitting response to his values, I took up this work. Motivated by Dr. J. Mann’s interview on the HIV/AIDS outbreak, which would leave behind millions of orphans, I thought that I could do something to reduce their sufferings.”,In 1989, she along with her family members and friends founded the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud International (FXB International), in the name of her late son. The NGO was formed to support the orphans and vulnerable children left in the wake of the dreaded pandemic.,“FXB offers comprehensive support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The overall strategy of FXB is the practical implementation of the inextricable link between health and human rights in the daily lives of its 16 million beneficiaries across nations. Today, FXB counts more than 100 programs in 18 countries, including 33 FXB-Villages, and has a staff of more than 450 and 1,400 volunteers,” says Albina.,
,
,She came to India 18 years ago and the countess says that she has a special bonding with the country. “Given its unique and diverse cultural fabric, to start work on an issue that is still considered a taboo was not easy. The vastly heterogeneous social order has all the ingredients to pave way for rapid spread of the virus. Poverty, commercial sex work, migrant workers and the vast population of truckers contribute largely to the spread of the disease. If the governor of one state allowed me to start my work the other threw the spanner in my spokes. But despite all odds, we have been able to take the initiative under the FXB Suraksha programme and could establish five FXB villages in different states,” says she.,Albina feels that the country is sitting on a smouldering volcano called AIDS and it will erupt soon to leave behind thousands of orphans, both affected and infected. Appreciating the work done by the government’s in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, she points out that in many of the states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the survey has not been done properly to assess the scenario.,
,
,The FXB villages are located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh; Aizawl, Mizoram; Imphal, Manipur; Dhapa-Tangra, West Bengal; and Medinipur, West Bengal. Each village supports about 80 to 100 families by providing basic package, comprising healthcare, education, nutrition support and psychological support. “We also provide training and seed money to the widowed women to make them self reliant and self sufficient. Treatment of opportunistic diseases and anti-retroviral therapy forms part of the activities at the villages. Over 2,600 AIDS orphans are among the daily beneficiaries at the villages,” informs she.,FXB Suraksha is also into counselling of pregnant women to stop the transmission of the virus from mother-to-child and has a huge awareness programme. Its innovative barber intervention programme was highly successful in the state of Delhi and other states in northern India.,Despite all her efforts, she still feels that a lot needs to be done. She says that community participation is needed to fight the pandemic. “Fight AIDS not people with AIDS,” says Albina du Boisrouvray."

,TIRUNELVELI: The recent campaign conducted in 19 blocks of the district through mobile cultural troupes to create awareness among the rural masses about HIV/AIDS has created significant impact over the villagers.,In an effort to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission and create awareness of the prevention services available in the districts for pregnant mothers and rural population under the programme ‘Vaazhkkai Vaazhvatharke...’ (Life is to Live), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) has initiated a State-wide campaign in association with district administrations across 10 districts.,As many as 12 mobile teams with elaborate information on HIV / AIDS and the services available, cultural troupes with 96 performers would cover Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Madurai, Theni, Tiruchi, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri and The Nilgiris districts during the 50-day campaign.,Printed materials available in the vans and cultural performers disseminate information on understanding HIV/AIDS, existing programmes and health services to prevent transmission of HIV from parent to child, information on treating sexually transmitted infections and the nearest service providers to the village.,When the cultural troupes recently visited nearly 180 villages of the district to reach out over 1.50 lakh population through varied communication formats, the impact left behind in the village was tremendous as the villagers could get new information about the dreaded disease and erased some of their misconceptions.,
,
,In addition to the cultural teams, exhibitions set up in the villages clarified the doubts of the villagers. Ten well-trained volunteers further moved into the interior parts of the villages and reach out to the people individually with information on STIs, preventing the parent to child infection and the nearest services available.,“Some fallacies we had about AIDS and HIV infection have been removed, thanks to this campaign and hence it should be ,” said K. Murugan of Reddiyarpatti.,According to TANSACS, Tamil Nadu stands first in responding to the HIV epidemic in the areas of prevention, treatment, care and support services. This has helped to reduce HIV prevalence in the State to 0.25 per cent. The ongoing campaign is likely to intensify TANSACS’ attempts on preventing the prevalence and ensure that people in rural areas have full information regarding HIV/AIDS and access to proper services.,Prevention of infection from parent to child counsellor at Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, Sahayarani, noted that adequate services were available free of cost in the nearest Primary Health Centres and hence the women should understand that HIV/AIDS can be prevented from affecting their children. They could speak to the local outreach workers before coming to the centres.,Positive People’s Welfare Society member Kumar of Kokkirakulam said this campaign was very timely and would have good impact over the poor and uneducated women. “Now, the women would have understood that prevention of HIV infection from mother to children is possible,” he noted."

Rayalaseema region had a share in the Godavari even though the river did not flow in the area.,
,
,Also, he said there was need to compensate the water loss to Kurnool district on account of diversion of 10 tmcft to Anantapur from Tungabhadra dam. He urged the government to create new districts at Nandyal and Tirupathi for administrative convenience. He said the upland area of Kurnool district was drought-prone while Nandyal was relatively fertile region. Kurnool area did not qualify for drought relief often because of higher yields from other parts of the district. Creation of new districts would help both areas. Also, there was demand for creation of another district with headquarters at Guntakal.,He offered a fee of Rs.1 crore from Rayalaseema Hakkula Ikdya Vedika to K. Chandrasekhar Rao of TRS for teaching the blackmail politics so that Rayalaseema could also benefit from the pressure tactics.,He termed the resignation of Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao as a drama to divert and dilute the antagonism against him.

However, there was a “magic bullet” for treating HIV; which had enzymatic capabilities as well. Reminding the students and doctors at Katuri, he said that - HAART, and other T-cell vaccinations had failed. In some patients, HIV had developed a resistance to HAART treatment. Cytotoxic t-cells were not useful, as they could not keep up with all of the HIV mutations.,Suggesting the best possible vaccination he said currently Synthetic Peptide, activated with an electrophile, known as E-VAC could break down the CD4 binding site of the HIV virus protein. Antibodies were catalytic, in the sense that catalysts were a single antibody that catalyze the breakdown of multiple HIV proteins per minute. The halflife of antibody was approximately equivalent to 20 days, he explained.,Professor Sudhir Paul and Professor Yauhiro Nishiyama had engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the gp 120 / CD4 binding site. The superantigenic region was the region of HIV that does not change, if it does change, then the HIV cannot bind to the CD4 region. Further explaining his work he said that once the abzyme has cut the HIV molecule, IgM, IgG, IgA (all naturally occurring antibodies) can further target the HIV molecules and destroy them.,He looked at genetically different strains of HIV. Viruses taken from different strains of the HIV virus were infected into human cells in the presence of the Lupus HIV-CAB. All of the viruses were seen to be neutralized."

The emphasis was on prevention through a region in the virus that is “quite constant” and useful for binding it to the cell. The team focused research on the covalent approach, rather than existing vaccines which are non-covalent in nature, to break the tolerance of the virus.,The method was adopted to see that the covalent vaccine, containing chemical extract, not only binds with the cell, but also ensures generation of more antibodies to prevent the spread of the virus. The approach was necessitated as the virus mutates rapidly and coupled with this was the immunity to the highly active retroviral therapies being used.,“Experiments have shown that we can break the tolerance and induce the cells to produce more antibodies that are broadly reactive to diverse strains so that the infection by all strains of the virus could be stopped,” he told The Hindu.

The public hearing accommodated over 20 children affected and infected by HIV.,Shanta Sinha, chairperson, NCPCR, said a number of cases of abuse had come up during the public hearing, directly attributable to stigma and discrimination still present in society. While there was definitely cause for concern, she appreciated the efforts of the State government of Tamil Nadu in bringing down numbers of children with HIV.,The government was doing a good job in terms of providing care and support structures to the children and added that there was much scope for improvement.,The jury, headed by Ms. Sinha, comprised Deepa Dixit and Lov Verma of NCPCR, Geetha Ramaseshan, senior advocate, and Jaya Shreedhar, Director, Media Foundation.,The respondents included representatives of government, including V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary for Health; M.P.Nirmala, Commissioner of Social Welfare; S.Vijaya Kumar, Project Director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society; and other district collectors.,Tamil Nadu has set up the OVC Trust to provide assistance to children infected with HIV/AIDS or those born to parents with the infection. So far, a total of 1,595 orphan children have been given educational assistance at a cost of Rs.44 lakh; 7,937 infected children have been identified and registered at 35 ART centres; six community care centres have been set up and 39 drop –in centres have been established, according to authorities.,A proposal for nutritional assistance for children and their families has been submitted to the Social Welfare department as a similar scheme offered by TANSACS had come to an end in August 2009."

Sastry, Additional District Medical and Health Officer and AIDS and Leprosy Officer, Krishna district.,TB has been identified as the leading infectious killer of people living with HIV, while HIV activates dormant TB in a person, who then becomes infectious and spreads the TB bacillus to others.,“In the last four months, as many as 1,787 HIV positive people were tested for TB. Of them, 332 tested positive. Similarly, of the 1069 TB patients tested for HIV, 120 have been found positive for HIV. The patients have been referred to the TB centre and to the ICTC centre, respectively.

Female sex workers, MSMs, migrant workers were the target groups under “Shubham”. The district authorities conducted special camps at the work places of these high-risk groups . “Now that they know their positive status, they will avoid indulging in risk behaviour and that means curbing the spread of virus to a great extent,” says Dr. Sastry."

,Hyderabad: A broad consensus has emerged on the need for a policy decision to address the issue of right to education of children living with HIV/AIDS. Whether government or private, every school must be obligated to admit children living with HIV/AIDS.,A roundtable held here on Thursday called for mounting a unified response to safeguard the right of the affected children, particularly in the light of their open stigmatisation and denial of right to schooling. The roundtable was jointly held by the Centre for Advocacy and Research, Freedom Foundation, M.V. Foundation and Divya Disha.,The recent incidents of children being thrown out of schools simply because they were HIV positive dominated the proceedings. While the landmark Education Bill passed by Parliament providing free and compulsory education was welcome, instances of discrimination against the affected children were cause for worry, the participants felt.,
,
,It was agreed to launch a campaign to dispel the myths and misconceptions about HIV and ensuring education to the affected children without any discrimination. Every school should have a counselling resource group to carry out in-house programmes. A ten-member task force was formed to put in place a mechanism to ensure education of affected children and to take care of violations, if any.,R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, A.P. State Aids Control Society, said there were 50,000 HIV-affected children in the State of whom 17,000 were being reached through various programmes.

It was also an occasion for Health Department officials and international NGOs to share their experiences in the fight against tuberculosis.,

Enough information should be made available to patients to curb the incidence of MDRTB, he said.,For MDRTB, treatment was as long as two years and the cost was 8-10 times higher, said Kerry Pelzman from the USAID.,“Since tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among HIV infected people, there is need to coordinate the two programmes,” said Dr. Sanjay Kapoor from the USAID. When a person got in touch with the HIV control programme, he must immediately be referred to the DOTS programme, he said.,Family Health International (FHI) which, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started the Avahan initiative to address HIV-related issues, included a tuberculosis awareness programme in six high prevalence States.,“We have been able to reach 2,50,000 people from marginalised communities who would normally not have access to tuberculosis detection or the DOTS programme through peer education,” said Dr. Bitra George, FHI country director."

,
,The most likely explanation for the new find is gorilla-to-human transmission, Plantier’s team said. But they added they cannot rule out the possibility that the new strain started in chimpanzees and moved into gorillas and then humans, or moved directly from chimpanzees to both gorillas and humans.,The 62-year-old patient tested positive for HIV in 2004, shortly after moving to Paris from Cameroon, according to the researchers. She had lived near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, but said she had no contact with apes or bush meat, a name often given to meat from wild animals in tropical countries.,The woman currently shows no signs of AIDS and remains untreated, though she still carries the virus, the researchers said.,How widespread this strain is remains to be determined. Researchers said it could be circulating unnoticed in Cameroon or elsewhere. The virus’ rapid replication indicates that it is adapted to human cells, the researchers reported.,

It had been thought that the breaks in the skin were the reason for higher HIV rates, but a study last year found that treatment of herpes with drugs did not reduce the HIV risk.,

,NEW DELHI: It was a meeting of hearts as parliamentarians and those from fields as diverse as cinema and cricket had an interface with children affected by HIV/AIDS here on Thursday.,The reassurance that they will do their best to drum up support for the HIV/AIDS Bill that is aimed at mitigating the impact of the epidemic on women and children was music to the ears of all those who were curious to know certain provisions of the Bill.,In his inaugural speech, senior Congress leader Oscar Fernandes said he first realised the terrible consequence of the AIDS epidemic when he met a jawan suffering from the disease. “The jawan told me that he was suffering from HIV and would no longer be allowed to enter my office. His parents had ostracised him and he was dejected. I realised that AIDS was no longer restricted to statistics but had entered our homes. My first reaction was to save my children. My daughter has done an internship at the United Nations and has been involved in youth forum leadership to keep HIV at bay. Even though there are other contentious issues, I want to assert that it will be our priority to table the Bill in Parliament.”,Bollywood film-maker Nagesh Kukunoor said it was much easier making movies than speaking from the same platform where Mr. Fernandes had delivered such an inspiring speech.,“While I was making Rockford I had a bad car accident near Salem and was bleeding profusely. I was rushed to a small government hospital. Even though I was in a semi-conscious state, I told the doctor that under no circumstances he should give me blood transfusion. Even in that vulnerable position I had fear of contacting the disease. I appeal to the powers that be to push forward the Bill.”,Pitching for the early passage of the Bill to enable children affected by the disease to get their due rights, cricketer Virender Sehwag said even though players were spending a lot of time on the field yet they were aware of social issues plaguing the society.,“When I made my debut in 2001, Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid supported various causes. It is sad that nobody wants to talk to children affected by HIV/AIDS. As a cricketer I want to reassure the children present here that they will get their rights. I want all of you to live your live fully.”,Union Minister of State for Rural Development Agatha Sangma said even though her tenure as an MP and Minister has just begun she realises her responsibility as a parliamentarian to get the Bill passed.,“Each one of us has to work in a particular role to see to it that the Bill is passed without any further delay. Our parliamentarians are knowledgeable and are aware of the issue. I will muster support among MPs for this important Bill.” The interface was organised by Plan India, a child-centred development organisation."

,HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) Director R. Chandravadan has cautioned people against utilising the services for HIV testing at private clinics, saying they do only one test as against three done compulsorily by the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs).,At a press conference here on Thursday, he said “it is dangerous to go to private services. It is a big mistake.” While the ICTCs carry out three tests on a mandatory basis, most of the times in private services, only one test was conducted which was also not “fool-proof.” He said the private nursing homes do not have trained lab technicians and counsellors for dealing with HIV cases.,
,
,Mr. Chandravadan announced that APSACS was launching a special campaign ‘Shubam’ to promote voluntary HIV testing among the most vulnerable groups like female sex workers, men having sex with men, migrants and truckers. The campaign will be taken up in a mission mode manner from July 12 to 30. It aims to improve referral to testing centres, convert all unknown HIV cases to known cases and streamline positive cases towards care, support and treatment services. Around one lakh people were expected to get tested during the special drive.,He said that of the total projected population of 8, 48, 43, 957 in the State, an estimated 50 per cent were sexually active adults. Among them, 25. 45 lakh (six per cent) were estimated to be prone to risky sexual behaviour. He said that it was estimated that the population of high risk groups was 1.64 lakh and only 10 per cent of them know their HIV status.,
,
,The Shubam campaign would also address the general population and would be conducted every year. He said HIV prevalence continued to be on the downward trend and the goal was to totally reverse and halt its spread by 2012.,Currently, there were 677 ICTCs in the State and another 250 would be started soon. Another 80 such centres would be started in Public-Private Partnership mode in private nursing homes."

,Bangalore: The health scenario in the State is likely to go in for a toss in the next 15 days. While government doctors, who have been demanding pay parity, incentives and time-bound promotions, are determined to resign en masse on September 29 as their demands have not been met, the 650 HIV/AIDS counsellors working for the Government are also planning to strike work from October 5 pressing for higher wages.,All the 4,199 government doctors, including the Director (Health and Family Welfare Services) and joint directors, will submit their letters to the Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) I.R. Perumal on Monday.,“Although we will give 15 days for the Government to accept our resignations, we will be grateful if it relieves us on the first day itself. We will set up private clinics outside the hospitals where we are working and ensure that patients are not put to hardship,” H.N. Ravindra, president of Karnataka Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) said.,He explained that the package announced after the Cabinet meet on Friday was just eyewash. “They have shown a house rent allowance of Rs. 2,810 for general duty medical officers. But only 500 of the 2,586 officers who are posted in urban areas are eligible for this. The rest working in rural areas will continue to get Rs. 700. This is an example of how the Government is hoodwinking us,” Dr. Ravindra said.,“The Government has fooled us by offering a marginal hike. We do not wish to continue working as bonded labourers,” he added.,Meanwhile, members of the Karnataka State HIV/AIDS Counsellor’s Association, who have been demanding regularisation of their services and higher wages, have threatened to strike work from October 5.,“We will not send the monthly report for September to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Although NACO had five months ago directed the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) to double our salaries from Rs. 6,500, nothing has been done so far. Besides, KSAPS has threatened to terminate our services if we go ahead with the strike,” Fayaz Ahmed, association secretary told The Hindu on Saturday. Though these counsellors were appointed on the basis of postgraduate employees’ wage scale, they are paid Rs. 6,500.,“We have been working for this amount for the last eight years. While most people want to stay away from HIV/AIDS infected people, our work is in association with them. Our main role is to prevent the spread and transmission of the dreaded disease from parent to child. Yet, we are paid much less than what graduate clerks are paid in other health offices,” Mr Ahmed pointed out."

,ANCHETTY (KRISHNAGIRI): A kattai panchayat in Sesurajapuram village in Krishnagiri district assumed “extra constitutional powers” and fined a woman recently. Her supposed sin: she is HIV infected.,Santhana Mary, whose husband, a victim of the dreaded disease, died one-and-a-half years ago, lives with her aged parents in the village with two daughters (fortunately not infected by the disease).,Mary ekes out a living by selling milk. Some youth, including a certain David, are alleged to have abused her on August 21. A distraught Mary told her parents about the incident and also her four brothers working as weavers in Erode.,When Mary’s mother Anthony Ammal went to David’s house to enquire about it she was said to have been beaten up and kicked by David and his father Arokyam. Her brothers – Ravi, Charles, Gnanaprakasam and Yesu – came to the village the same night. They went to David’s house to protest against the ill-treatment meted out to their mother and sister.,On August 22 some villagers went to Mary’s house and took her brothers, aged parents and a neighbour Periyasamy to the Anchetti police station alleging that they had damaged David’s house.,With the help of the police, village elders led by Marya Prakasam, a postman in Sesurajapuram village, reportedly conducted a kattai panchayat outside the police station and fined the family Rs. 30,000 for damaging David’s house. Mary’s brothers pleaded before the panchayat that they could pay only Rs. 15,000 and that they needed at least two weeks to pay the amount.,Mary, her brothers and parents were, however, detained by the police. A head constable on duty is alleged to have collected Rs. 2,000 from them to release them. A mediator (between the villagers and Mary’s family) Sandhiyahoo is said to have taken another Rs. 3,000 for food to the villagers who had come to the station.,Mary’s brothers came to the village from Erode on Sept. 12 with Rs. 15,000. Not content with this, Mr. Sandhiyahoo forcibly took a motor cycle belonging to Mr. Periyasamy, who had gone with the brothers, in lieu of the balance amount of Rs. 15,000. The vehicle was then handed over to the villagers who took the fine amount but refused to return the vehicle.,This was the last straw for Mary and her family. They petitioned the District Collector at the weekly grievances day meeting in Krishnagiri on Sept. 14.,The Collector, V.K.Shanmugham, directed the Superintendent of Police, A.G. Babu, to take appropriate action. Mr. Babu reprimanded the policeman who took Rs. 2000 and directed Sub-Inspector R. Manickam to retrieve the motor cycle and Rs. 15,000 from the villagers to return to Mary’s family.,Mr. Manickam got the vehicle back but is alleged to have asked Mary and her family members to give a written statement that David and her family had previous enmity. They, however, refused to give such a statement.,Mr. Manickam let the villagers off on Tuesday (Sept. 15) evening, but detained Mary and her family members, including the aged parents, till 11 p.m.,It was only at the intervention of Mr. Kumar, president, Krishnagiri District Living with HIV AIDS Welfare Society, that Mr. Manickam released them, after getting an assurance that they would come to the police station on Wednesday (Sept. 16) morning.,The vehicle is still with the police and Mary has not got back the Rs. 15,000 she had paid as fine. Mr. Manickam evaded a query as to whether any action had been initiated against the kattai panchayat but said he had registered first information reports against both the parties.,The police on Wednesday arrested Mary’s father Kannupaiyan and brothers Gnanaprakasam and Ravi and villagers Kuppu, Thammayan, Francis, Sesu alias Sesurajan and Arokyaraj. They were produced before the court in Denkanikottai which remanded them to judicial custody."

It was very touching,” recalls Hari Haran.,“When the Red Ribbon Express came here, I interacted with many HIV-affected youths who came for counselling. They confided in me that they had committed mistakes and were full of remorse. But then it was too late,” he said,Explaining the screenplay of the proposed short film, he says: “The film opens with the camera focusing on the trunk and later on the leaves of the banyan tree in the moonlight. In the next scene, the first rays of the sun fall on the tree indicating daybreak.”,“The sunrays do not fall on all the leaves uniformly. While some are exposed to the sun, others remain in the dark. Those that remain in the dark fall to the ground. Friends should be like the sun and dispel darkness from the lives of HIV patients by being sympathetic towards them and not abhorring them.”,“There will be 13 characters in the film and I plan to use animation extensively in the film for which a lot of money is required. I can direct the film myself but am not averse to giving the script to some filmmaker who can do justice to my script,” he says.,

Hopes of AIDS vaccine breakthrough dashed,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/Hopes-of-AIDS-vaccine-breakthrough-dashed/article15951696.ece'],)","SARAH BOSELEY,The vaccine did not protect those at high risk of HIV infection, such as sex workers and intravenous drug users,
,
,The first Aids vaccine to show an encouraging result in clinical trials is only modestly effective and did not protect those at highest risk of HIV, it emerged on 20 October, as U.S. and Thai researchers revealed their full results in Paris.,The announcement last month that the controversial $105 million trial carried out in Thailand had unexpectedly been successful took experts by surprise and sparked excitement around the world amid speculation that the steady spread of HIV/Aids could before long be checked.,However, it is now clear that this is a long way wide of the mark.,The full results, presented at the Aids vaccine conference in Paris and published immediately online by the New England Journal of Medicine reveal that:,- The vaccine did not protect those at high risk of HIV infection, such as sex workers and intravenous drug users.,- The protective effect was greatest in the first 12 months and then seemed to diminish.,- When those who did not get all six vaccine shots were taken out of the analysis, the positive result was statistically insignificant.,
,
,Some scientists and campaigners in Paris nevertheless hailed the results, if not as a triumph, then as a beacon of hope. Dr Nelson Michael of the US army — the US military had run the research programme with the Thai government — said scientists would now be working intensely to pick up clues to future Aids vaccine development from the results of the trial. “It is a signpost for vaccine development,” he said.,“This was a yes-we-can moment: the opportunity to become enthusiastic. The door has cracked open. We are all going to try to collectively crash through it.”,But Seth Berkley, president of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, which evaluates and channels funds into trials, said he thought the regime tested in Thailand would be taken no further.,The vaccines involved — AidsVax, which previously failed in a trial in Thailand on its own, and Alvac — were 15 years old.,
,
,“That’s why there was scientific controversy about starting this trial,” he said. “If you were going to start again, you might use one of the more robust vaccines we have [in the lab] today.,“We don’t have a vaccine on the horizon. It isn’t the Thai one or one of the others. That’s why we have to have the patience for this marathon rather than a sprint.”,The Thai trial, given the name RV144, was controversial from the start because it involved two vaccines given together, one of which had previously failed to protect people from HIV while the other had not been tested alone.,Many people felt the $105million it cost could be better spent.,More than 16,400 Thai men and women aged 18 to 30 who did not have HIV were recruited and randomly assigned to receive the vaccine or a placebo.,They were given six shots over six months: two of Alvac followed by two more sessions where they were injected with both vaccines. They were tested for HIV every six months, and counselled on how to avoid it for the next three years.,By the end of the trial only 125 people had become infected with HIV. In the announcement of the headline results last month, it was said that 51 of those given the vaccine had become HIV positive compared with 74 in the placebo group, which gives a statistically significant efficacy of 31 per cent.,
,
,But many volunteers did not get all six vaccinations, taking the numbers down from around 8,000 in each group to around 6,000. Removing those who did not get all the six vaccinations was done in accordance to the protocol.,Among those people, there were 50 infections on placebo and 36 on the vaccine, which gives an efficacy of 26 per cent but is not statistically significant, meaning it could happen by chance.

Initially, these centres motivated persons belonging to the high-risk groups to come for testing. But now, the general public are being motivated to take the test, project director of PACS Gilbert Fernandez said.,Voluntary HIV testing saw 14,000 takers in 2005, followed by 17,000 in 2006. The number increased to 20,000 in 2007 and 21,500 in 2008. “Increased level of awareness is one of the reasons for so many persons to come for the test. Many young women have become aware and opt for testing,” he said.,For instance, out of the total persons who came for testing in 2007, 11,000 were men and 9,000 were women. Similarly, 13,500 men and 8,000 women took the voluntary testing in 2008, according to PACS.,“This trend has definitely brought down the percentage of positivity from six per cent in 2005 to four per cent in 2008. A larger section of the general population are utilising the testing services, leading to a downward trend in positivity,” Dr. Fernandez said.,Nearly 64,000 persons volunteered for testing in 60 days during a special drive held two years ago for the general population, he recalled.,There are 10 ICTCs across the Union Territory — six in Puducherry, two in Karaikal and one each in Mahe and Yanam.

Already, six to seven PHCs have been identified, he stated.,The voluntary HIV testing would enable people to know their status like in any other condition, he said, adding, “Many persons with no high-risk behaviour such as antenatal mothers and newly wed women have tested positive for HIV as the partner might be a person with risky behaviour.

,BERHAMPUR: A new rapid HIV testing technology named ‘whole blood finger-prick’ would be introduced in the State soon.,According to Orissa State Aids Control Society (OSACS) sources this new rapid testing technology is being introduced by the NACO in Orissa along with Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Uttar Pradesh.,This new technology would enable testing of HIV status of a person within 20 minutes. For a general public the testing would be similar to the blood test for malaria.,The project director of OSACS, Alekh Chandra Padhiary said the major advantage of the ‘whole blood finger-prick’ technology is that for it there would be no need to separate serum and red blood cells of a blood sample to test for HIV. This technology has been quite successful in Africal countries where most people are being tested for HIV by this new and fast technology. The conventional HIV testing kits being used now accept only serum collected from blood samples to test for HIV antibody. The presence of HIV antibody in one’s blood hints at HIV infection.,A centrifuge which separates the serum from the blood is a major need of conventional HIV testing technologies.,The new technology being tried now accepts whole blood and can tell HIV status by a simple finger prick.,A workshop was organised in Bhubaneswar on Thursday for the implementation of this HIV testing technology in Orissa. It was attended by a team from the NACO, officials of the OSACS, Chief District Medical Officers (CDMO) of Ganjam, Angul, Koraput, Bolangir, Balasore and Bhadrak districts.,These are HIV prone districts of Orissa.,The process of HIV testing through ‘whole blood finger-prick’ is expected to be first introduced in Ganjam district, the most AIDS prone district of Orissa.,
,
,Through this technique the Auxiliary Nurse cum Midwives (ANM) of remote areas would be able to test blood samples of pregnant women so in case of HIV infection they could be taken to the Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres early to save the stillborns from HIV infection.,In Ganjam district married women usually get infected by their HIV infected migrant labourer husbands."

,
,Mr. Fernandes suggested that every pregnant woman be tested for HIV to ensure that the disease was not transmitted to the child. “This should be done right at the panchayat level as mother-to-child transmission is a violation of the human rights of the child. Unfortunately, we cannot make it mandatory since we do not have the mechanism for this.” To achieve this, institutional delivery had to be encouraged. At present the percentage of mother-to-child transmission was about 18 per cent.,
,
,As part of his first official visit to India as UNAIDS executive director, Michel Sidibe participated in the function. He described the Delhi High Court judgment as historic, but said decriminalising drug use and sex work was still a long way off.,

The NACO’s decision to further decentralise the programme during NACP-III has given birth to District AIDS Prevention and Control Units (DAPCUs).,“This is aimed at optimisation of scarce resources and the provision of seamless services to those in need of medical assistance at the grass-root level and also for ensuring long term sustainability of the interventions,” says T.V.S.N. Sastry, Additional District Medical & Health Officer and AIDS and Leprosy Officer for Krishna district.,The DAPCU, which will come into existence in Krishna district from April 1, will have the freedom to design need-based programmes based on the prevailing local circumstances.

We have also asked for establishment of link centres at Gudivada and Nuzvid,” he says, explaining that once that happens, people will not have to travel long distance for treatment as the nearest local centre will take care of their medical needs. Krishna district currently has 4,500 HIV positive people put on ART.,

HIV entry ban repealed,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/HIV-entry-ban-repealed/article16485944.ece'],)","By announcing the end of a 22-year-old ban on the entry of people with HIV into the United States, President Barack Obama has once again shown that scientific considerations alone would shape decisions concerning science. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has followed up promptly, by publishing the rule in the Federal Register. The U.S. was one of a dozen countries that have archaic laws barring the entry of people infected by HIV. Although President George Bush amended the Immigration and Nationality Act last year, the HHS did not remove it from the list of communicable diseases. The ban in the U.S. was enacted in 1987 amidst widespread fears that HIV, like tuberculosis, was a communicable disease and spread through physical or respiratory contact. Accordingly, HIV infection was enlisted as a “communicable disease of public health significance” and the entry of visitors and immigrants with the infection banned. Despite the aetiology and routes of transmission of HIV becoming clearer over the last two decades, and UNAIDS and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) concluding, in 2004, that “HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions have no public health justification,” the irrational bar remained.,In fact, the illiberal law has not served the purpose of containing the spread of a virus that has become endemic in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the virus has infected about one million people. The entry ban has also ended up creating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and this in turn has kept people away from getting tested. According to the CDC, about one in five are not aware of their infection status and are responsible for 50-70 per cent of all new sexually transmitted infection cases. The fear of discrimination is one reason why the CDC 2006 recommendation that everyone between 13 years and 64 years should be routinely tested for the infection in medical encounters has not been heeded. An offshoot of the ban is that no international HIV/AIDS scientific conference has been held in the U.S. for the past 20 years. All this is likely to change. The U.S., which has played a pivotal role in fighting the war against the virus in Africa, can now set its house in order. Nearly half a dozen sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea have been wrongly classified as communicable diseases of public health significance. The CDC may remove them from its list in due course after a scientific review."

They could get access to all tests under one roof, including enumeration of CD4 cells, most important tests to take decision whether to initiate therapy for HIV patients or not, thanks to the installation of most advanced BD FACS Cluster Determiner 4 equipment at Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre in Dindigul Headquarter Government Hospital. Commissioning work was over. It would be put to use in a day or two, according to sources in the GH.,The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) has offered this equipment costing Rs.8 lakh to the GH. “It is a boon to HIV patients and physicians. It is a new and reliable test for the enumeration of CD4 cells in peripheral blood,” said doctors in the GH.,With the installation of this equipment, the ART Centre has wiped out its last resource-constraint. The CD4 lymphocytes (T-helper cells) were the major target cells of HIV infection. Progressive decline in CD4 levels, caused by various pathological processes associated with HIV infection, would increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections. The CD4 counts would serve as the major clinical indicators of immune competence in HIV patients. It would also help doctors in decision-making whether to initiate the therapy or not, doctors added.,If the CD counts level was less than 200, Anti-Retroviral treatment would be commenced immediately as this level indicated severe weakened immune system. If the level was more than 200, effective counselling would be given to patients to maintain nutrition levels.,The ART centre had been referring on an average 250 cases to Madurai for this test every month. From now, they could avail this facility in Dindigul GH itself.,The ART Centre also has HIV detection facilities, ART treatment, Legal Aid Cell for persons living with HIV and tests and treatment facilities for all venereal diseases under single roof. With this facility, the ART centre in Dindigul has become a full fledged institution to cater to all the needs of persons with HIV, doctors added."

,CHENNAI: While persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) unanimously agree that the situation in Tamil Nadu has improved in the last five years and the hard-nosed advocacy to ensure that they are not discriminated against has helped, life is far from normal.,PLHAs still face trouble in getting a rental accommodation, medical treatment and are the first to be laid off. They end up paying twice or three times more for medical treatment as they do not want to be denied access to healthcare.,“The moment I declare my condition, in a government hospital they will give me a bed in the corner of the room or near the bathroom. In private hospitals they will say we don’t have facility or ask us to pay twice or three times more for a procedure,” says P. Kousalya President, Positive Women Network (PWN+).,She recalls that a computer professional was asked to return to his home country after the organisation he was working for in the city learnt of his status.,When it comes to providing pension to the widowed, officials expedite the process if a widow declares herself positive, Ms. Kousalya says.,In such cases, a woman would receive her pension within three months. A PLHA certificate ensures that government pension is settled quickly, says Ms. Kousalya, who declared herself a widow to prevent delays.,Recalling an incident at the Government Hospital in Chengalpet a fortnight ago where a woman was thrown out of the hospital after she was found to be positive, K.K. Abraham, president of Indian Network for People living with HIV/AIDS, says, “Disclosure of status is not easy as there is fear of discrimination. In rural areas discrimination is more.” A volunteer at Government Kilpauk Hospital admits that the behaviour of the hospital staff differs when they learn of the patient’s positive status.,

,“Neglect of women who come for pregnancy or abortion is very common,” says Sujatha Natarajan, President of Family Planning Association of India, which works with PLHA.,In the last six months her organisation provided abortion services to three pregnant women in Chennai who were denied treatment by private hospitals.,“Excuses abound. All this happens in the name of caution. With all the sensitisation which we are doing for others discrimination comes from the medical fraternity. The situation is worse for unmarried women, a transgender or commercial sex workers. Non-judgemental approach to the issue has not happened.,S. Manimegalai, a PLHA working in Villupuram district, says disclosure will happen when the house owner gets curious about the frequent hospital visits.,“So long as our health is good and we look good, no doubts arise but once the status is known we are asked to vacate the house,” she says.,There have also been instances where a person was laid off on the pretext that the company had moved to a far-off place.,YRG Care will soon inaugurate a special surgical unit for PLHA on its campus and a special unit for dialysis for positive people was started only last week in the city by TANKER Foundation."

So we have to modify our information and communication strategies years,” he added.,Clearly there is a need to step up activities of the Red Ribbon Clubs, started in educational institutions to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS, he suggested. However, if all agencies focussing on their allocated tasks properly, then it was possible to reach a stage of zero new infections, Mr.Subburaj said.,Earlier, he released a monograph on the results of the 12th wave of the BSS in Tamil Nadu and the seventh survey in Puducherry since 2001. The survey was conducted across 13 different population groups in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Theni, Salem, Vellore, Erode, Nagercoil, Dindigul, Palani, Tiruchirapalli and Tuticorin. In Pondicherry, the survey covered Puducherry and Karaikal districts. Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Tiruchi, Karur, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin were covered as Intensive Intervention Districts of APAC.,The population groups were female sex workers, truckers and helpers, male youth in slums, factory workers, migrant workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, transgenders, male patients at STD Clinics, Students and for the first time, People Living with HIV were included.,The key results indicated that there were both positives and negatives, Bimal Charles, director, APAC, said. Knowledge on at least two correct methods of preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV was close to 100 percent among all population groups except among female factory and migrant workers. Again, respondents almost universally reported that consistent condom usage prevents HIV, but more efforts are required to counter myths and misconceptions in intervention programs to spread awareness of STI and HIV.,As far as condom use goes, while it is high with paid partners, usage with non-paid or regular partners is comparatively lower. Needle sharing behaviour among IDUs has been showing a declining trend across all the waves and in the current wave, around 43.0 per cent reported such behaviour.,The incidence of STI is low in all categories and the treatment-seeking-behaviour from a qualified health practitioner continued to be very high, with a majority approaching a government STD clinic for the treatment.,There has been an increase in testing practices among all groups except migrant workers, factory workers and youth in slums. This is mainly due to the fact that risk perception among them is low, APAC officials pointed out.,S.Vijayakumar, project director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, said the key now is to use the lessons of the BSS to translate interventions into action.,Also indicating that a “zero-infection” rate was within the realm of achievement in the State, he urged all partners to ensure that healthcare is provided comprehensively and cost effectively to all those who need it.,E.S.Krishnamoorthy, honorary secretary, Voluntary Health Services, said the studying behaviour is important as it helps to plan for the future, prevent further infections, and stem the tide of the epidemic, at least in this instance. There are many lessons from the data of the BSS that could change the way policy is drawn up in future, he added."

,Chennai: The State government will start extending financial assistance to orphaned children of HIV/AIDS victims in Tamil Nadu from November 14, Principal Secretary, Health, V.K. Subburaj said here on Tuesday.,A trust with a corpus fund of Rs.5 crore was created with the objective of extending educational and medical assistance to orphaned children of HIV/AIDS victims. A total of 1,612 children in Tamil Nadu had been identified as eligible for the aid, the senior official said, participating in a function at the Training Centre of Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) in Tambaram Sanatorium. The function was to mark the valedictory of the fourth year and commencement of the fifth-year batch of HIV Fellowship, Clinical and Leadership Training Programme.,Interest from the corpus fund of Rs.5 crore would be used to meet the medical, educational and other expenses. About Rs.45 lakh would be spent every year, he said. Pointing out that Tamil Nadu was a model for the entire country not only in general healthcare but also for HIV/AIDS care, the senior official said the government spent Rs.110 crore a year on creating facilities and improving infrastructure, among others.,Mr. Subburaj said that while the national death rate among HIV/AIDS patients was 7.9 per cent a year, it was only a little over 4 per cent in Tamil Nadu. Further, the national average of patients discontinuing from treatment was 10.2 per cent per year and it was just 2.5 per cent in the State. This was possible because of better treatment facilities made available to patients.,The level of awareness and the need to invest more in HIV/AIDS was due to the nature of the disease and associated problems of stigma and discrimination. Though tuberculosis claimed more lives in Tamil Nadu, the government spent only Rs.10 crore on combating TB, Mr. Subburaj pointed out. He appealed to doctors who had completed the fellowship programmes in the past four years to provide the best of care to the affected people.,G. Manoharan, medical director, I-TECH, said that along with GHTM, they had been conducting the fellowship programme since 2005 to prepare junior and fairly experienced doctors to be leaders in HIV/AIDS-related care and support, education and research in India and also to support the State government.,Till now, 49 people had completed this fellowship programme and 30 per cent of them were women. Of the 49, a majority were from Tamil Nadu, while there were many others from the high-prevalence States of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra and also from Karnataka, Kerala and New Delhi.,Mr. Subburaj released an abstract of the projects taken up for research by fellows in the past four years. S. Vinayagam, Director of Medical Education, released a fellowship curriculum package on the occasion.,Thomas Keaton,Vice-Consul, U.S. Consulate, Chennai, said such fellowships were a good example of public-private partnership programmes in the areas of HIV/AIDS care."

The rest are provided with nutrition enhancement tablets, according to informed sources.,Obviously, the high number of number of HIV/AIDS infected persons in the district is viewed by the medical fraternity as a cause for extreme concern, but the rise in the number of patients over the years is also attributed to the sensitisation programmes. The affected people are learning to live with the reality. As many as 2,000 among those who receive ART are members of the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS. The Network that has been reaching out to affected people to sensitise them through peer educators to the avenues for treatment through Global Fund Round 4 Access to Care and Treatment (ACT) Project is keen on taking the awareness exercise to the doorsteps of the ignorant people.,It organises periodic conventions for the 110 peer educators it has trained so far to enlist more members in the Network. According to M. Vijayalakshmi, president of Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS, middle class people have begun to shed their diffidence and are turning up to the ART centres. The Network has, however, been only partially successful in extending the sensitisation exercise to the identified patients belonging to higher economic or social strata. This section apparently prefers private treatment. The therapy when availed at private clinics costs at least Rs. 2,000 per patient a month.,At a recent peer educator convention organised by the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS, the participants were honoured for their services and motivated to carry on with their work on a voluntary basis. The event served as a forum for them to share their experiences and accomplishments and to devise strategies to further firm up the network at the grass roots.,According to Ms. Vijayalaksmi, the educational activities being organised for the peer educators have developed their knowledge and attitudes. They have been imparted with the skill training for remaining healthy and simultaneously carry out the sensitisation tasks for protecting the health of other HIV affected people they come across or go after."

,Bangalore: Karnataka is one of the States in India with a high HIV prevalence, with an estimated 2.75 lakh people currently living with the virus. But there is heartening news on the eve of World AIDS Day: targeted prevention interventions have played a significant role in controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact.,
,
,A mathematical modelling projection based on studies done in two districts by the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), established by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and University of Manitoba (UM), shows that the situation would have been far worse but for the interventions that have been scaled up effectively since 2003.,HIV sentinel surveillance among ante-natal clinic (ANC) populations in 27 districts over the years shows that the HIV prevalence has come down from 1.6 per cent in 2003 to 0.86 in 2007-08.,In sheer numbers, this reduction in prevalence would reduce the number of HIV-positive newborns by over 2,000 every year. “This is much greater than the most optimistic estimates from Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) programmes,” says Dr. Stephen Moses, Project Director of the Sankalp/Corridors Project (Avahan India-AIDS initiative) implemented by the KHPT. Karnataka is the only State to have a government Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre in every district.,Statistics show that Karnataka has been able to maintain high levels of treatment adherence. “As a result of good coordination at the district level, our ‘lost to follow up’ among patients on ART is about 3.2 per cent, while the national average is around 7 per cent,” says Dr. Reynold Washington, in-charge Project Director of the Samastha-USAID project in Karnataka.,However, a particular point of concern is the situation in north Karnataka districts, with high levels of HIV-TB co-infection. Districts in the region also show a higher HIV prevalence among the rural population.,The prevalence of HIV in Bagalkot is 2.38 per cent in urban population and 3.59 per cent in rural areas (2003). In contrast, in Mysore, it is 0.94 per cent (urban) and 0.71 per cent (rural)."

,VISAKHAPATNAM: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has become the first urban local body in the country to support a health insurance scheme for people living with HIV (PLHIV) with the launch of a group policy covering 200 persons. GVMC contributed 50 per cent of the premium to the health insurance scheme, the first in Andhra Pradesh for PLHIV.,The initiative has been taken in partnership with Population Service International (PSI) and with the support of US International Aid Agency Initiative Project Connect, to combat HIV/AIDS and TB. The ‘Star Net Plus Policy’ is offered by Star Health and Allied Insurance Company.,While in the other States it is being offered at a CD4 count of 500, the one in AP is with a count of 300. Population Services International and the person insured contribute 40 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.,
,
,Giving away the policy on Friday, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development D. Purandeswari cautioned against discrimination against those living with HIV/AIDS. The most important step was to see to it that HIV did not become full-blown AIDS. Rapid urbanisation with migrant population and housing problems was creating high risk groups.,US government HIV/AIDS coordinator Kimberly Waller described it as a beginning that had major global implications. Project Connect in its third year of implementation had successfully motivated SHAIC to come out with a policy for PLHIV.,

,Star Health Assistant vice-president C.P. Udayachandran said the policy, first introduced in Karnataka and later in Tamil Nadu so far covered 2,500 persons.,AP State AIDS Control Society Project Director R.V. Chandravadan said the State government would negotiate with Star for a better package for implementing it in the other districts.

,VISAKHAPATNAM: Incidence of HIV/AIDS can be reduced by collective effort and co-operation from all quarters, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development D. Purandeswari has said.,Speaking at the launch of first health insurance of PLHIV here on Friday, she said if Guntur which had recorded a rate of 3.35 per cent in 2003 could reduce it to 1.75 per cent other districts also could do it. If people shy away from talking about AIDS, it’s difficult to contain it, she said. Besides the number of people using intravenous drugs was going up. Also to contain HIV, it’s necessary to have an open debate about gay rights, particularly in the light of Supreme Court judgment on Article 377.,On the government’s efforts to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS, she said in spite of the high cost the government was spending a lot of money on giving ART medicines. Population Services International’s Program Director (Project Connect) Atul Kapoor said the public-private partnership that brought together several agencies could serve to encourage other public/private insurance companies to examine insurance to PLHIV.,
,
,State AIDS Control Society Project Director R.V. Chandravadan said in the nine coastal districts the number of HIV/AIDS persons was more than the State average of one per cent.,The State Government was spending Rs.85 crores this year on a comprehensive plan and next year it would go up to Rs.100 crores. The rise in the number of migrant labour and commercial sex workers in urban areas had led to more persons being infected. In Visakhapatnam it had gone up from .35 per cent in 2007 to .75 per cent in 2008. He also underlined the need to recognise gay sex (sexual minority groups) stating it was leading to incidence of more HIV. Soon Girisuraksha, a scheme for tribal areas, would be introduced.,Municipal Commissioner B. Sreedhar said the Visakha AIDS Control Society was launched in 2006 and with its activities won the appreciation of USAID. He appealed to USAID to associate itself with public health issues in the city. The 200 insured persons were drawn from organisations like Green Vision, FXB, World Vision and Society of Visakha Network of Positive Members.,Mayor Pulusu Janardhana Rao said the corporation was providing a pension of Rs.200 to the HIV/AIDS people and employment, by manning of public telephone booths.,PSI South Regional Director Shankar Narayanan spoke."

The HIV spread was as high as 24 per cent in 2003 and it was now down to 5.7 per cent, he said.,Karnataka had taken up the cause of those living with HIV by bringing out a charter to help them face discrimination in society.,The charter asserted that people living with HIV/AIDS should not be denied their rights. Recognising the rights and needs of those living with HIV/AIDS was central to an effective public health response and sex workers should be involved in the implementation of HIV/AIDS programmes.,It would enable them to empower themselves through education and information in order to protect themselves and minimise their vulnerability to and risk of contracting HIV, Mr. Meti said.,Thanks to the intervention activities by the Government and non-governmental organisations, the spread had been contained.,During 2008, the increase in the number of cases in the State was only by 0.69 per cent. Efforts were under way to provide free bus passes to those undergoing Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) and nutritional food at a subsidised cost.

Based on this, it can be said that the vaccine is safe.,However, one more volunteer visit in December is pending at both trial centres. The trial is considered to be complete after this visit and some tests are done to know certain aspects of the immune response. The final results are expected by early next year.,Both centres have seen 100 per cent volunteer retention till date.,
,
,The prime-boost vaccine has shown only a modest immune response. The safety and immune response seen are nearly similar at both trial centres.,The immune response produced by MVA in Group B (those who received only MVA) showed similar immune response compared with the earlier MVA trial conducted at TRC in 2008. In a way, the preliminary results of the current trail validate the earlier MVA trial.,Group B volunteers received three of MVA (MVA was used as a prime as well as a boost).,“Immune responses were better in Group A [who received ADVAX prime and MVA boost] volunteers compared with Group B,” said Dr. V. D. Ramanathan, Deputy Director at TRC and Principal Investigator of the trial at TRC. “At the sixth month the immune responses were better and more people responded to the vaccine and the immune responses were sustained for a longer time compared with Group B.”,However, on the whole, the magnitude of the immune response produced was only modest and did not sustain for very long. A vaccine can be called efficacious when the immune responses are seen in a large number of volunteers and are persistent.,Will the responses been better if a higher dose of MVA was used? “We feel that as we are using the prime-boost strategy, selecting the lower dose for boosting makes more sense. In combination strategies, using lower dose is likely to reduce harm, increase safety and optimise immunogenicity,” said Dr. Sanjay M. Mahendale, Deputy Director, and the Principle Investigator of the trial at NARI.,
,
,“We found the responses to be better when [volunteers] were primed by ADVAX followed by MVA,” said Dr. Ramanathan. “But how good the priming has been will be known only when the final, unblinded results come out,” he said.,However, ADVAX by itself produced very few immune responses. “We now know from various experiments (on animals and humans) that, in general, DNA vaccines by themselves are better at priming than being good ‘stand alone' immunogens,” explained Dr. Ramanathan.,The results mentioned here are however based on preliminary, blinded data. “We have one more volunteer visit and additional immunogenicity tests pending. We have to wait for these to be completed before drawing firm conclusions,” he cautioned.,But would the responses been different had the Group B volunteers received two doses, instead of one, of MVA prime? “It is very unlikely that the level of immune responses would go up once the immune response reaches a certain level when the same vaccine is used as both prime and boost,” said Dr. Ramesh Paranjape, Director of NARI.,The trial was essentially aimed at looking for three parameters — to see if the immune response is broad to the antigens used in the vaccine, to see how strong the response is, and finally to see if the response is sustained.,“The response is the same in both the groups, especially gap and env antigens that are critical. And the response has been moderate in both the groups,” said Dr. Paranjape. “But whether the response has sustained can be answered only on completion of the trial in December.”,According to Dr. Paranjape, the breath of the response and the level of response are unlikely to go up at the end of the trial. “Scientifically, it can only go down,” he said.,So what lessons can one learn from the current trial at TRC and NARI? “This trial re-establishes the safety of the MVA as a vector, and prime-boost regime is a viable strategy and this strategy should be continued to be evaluated,” said Dr. Rajat Goyal, Country Director, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), New Delhi. The trial was funded by IAVI.,He also emphasised that use of the MVA as a vector and prime-boost regime as a strategy should not be dropped.,
,
,YRG Care, Chennai recruited volunteers for the TRC arm of the trial. “Recruiting volunteers was easier this time,” said Dr. Suniti Solomon, Director of YRG Care. “There is more literacy in the community we are working with and the experience of the earlier trial [at TRC] made it easy.”"

The photographs capture the vulnerability and denial of rights that the children face every day.,
,
,As the media ethics demand that any representation of positive children should not be done without revealing their identity, the exhibition “Suffering Silence: Untold Story of Orphan HIV + Children” uses this challenge to use creative ways to tell the story and connect without compromising on the important message.,According to ActionAid, which is hosting the exhibition in association with British Council, India has a long way to go in ensuring the health and human rights of the poor and vulnerable. Poverty, gender inequalities, violence against women, trafficking, migration and disasters are all fuelling the epidemic.,While inadequate nutrition weakens the body, expensive medicines and poor government health systems make quality treatment out of reach for the majority, particularly in rural areas. Parents die in their prime and even orphaned children are not spared the stigma and discrimination that is often more vicious than the disease.,“Recent years have seen a disturbing trend of rising new infections in women, young people and children, pointing to the epidemic spreading to the general population and in rural areas,” said the non-government organisation.,The exhibition is on view till December 6."

This is especially true of Coimbatore district where a significant portion of its workforce is migrants.,A rapidly expanding industrial base _ and the consequent boom in jobs _ has attracted workers from far and wide to Coimbatore. Thus, the spotlight ought to be on these workers.,In the textile mills, about 50 per cent of workers are migrants. In engineering units, 40 to 50 per cent are from other districts and even other States. In the booming construction sector, migrant workers are employed in mega projects. Though there is no data, approximately 25 to 35 per cent of them are from outside.,“The main focus in the district now is migrant workers. We have to do much for them. Most of these workers are young. The risk of HIV/AIDS is higher if they are young (15 and 45 of age) and unmarried,” says Mohammed Ali, Programme Manager of District AIDS Prevention Control Unit. For the first time in the district, red ribbon clubs will be started at 30 industries on December 1. Each unit will receive Rs. 4,400 initially to create awareness and train peer leaders for awareness.,“We do workplace intervention for prevention. If workers test positive, they are given counselling and treatment.” Awareness is important for prevention, he says.,In an effort to assess the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among the migrant labour in Coimbatore, the Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research will embark on a survey on this section.,P. Ashok Kumar, Programme Manager, Targeted Intervention – Migrants Project, said that migrant workers at construction sites, factories, spinning mills and other industries would be tested for a HIV Sentinel Surveillance. Trained persons would visit the workers at their place, test a sample of five and send the report to the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University or the Christian Medical College, Vellore.,Mr. Kumar said this was the first time a survey would be done.,A maximum of 250 people would be tested across the district, starting January 2011.

He adds that once people come to know that they are HIV positive, they become introverts and refuse to talk about it in public. He underlines the need for initiating a discussion on the subject at the grassroots level so that its spread can be contained.,As per the Human Development Index report of Bijapur district, the number of HIV affected people in the district in 2005 was 2,887 of which 247 cases were from Basavan Bagewadi, 2,418 from Bijapur, 133 from Indi, 58 from Muddebihal and 30 from Sindagi taluk. Though Bagalkot district is a model in the country as far as Interventions for High Risk Groups are concerned, HIV prevalence among the general public is high. The early interventions in Bagalkot district in the form of India Canada Collaborative HIV AIDS project (ICHAP) and later by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) saw that the programmes for high risk groups saturated. The prevalence among sex workers has come down to six per cent in Mudhol and Jamakhandi taluks but the HIV prevalence among the bridge population is 41 percent and it is a little more than 50 per cent in the general population which is a cause for concern, according to experts.,Keeping this in view, the KSAPS had launched a door-to-door campaign in the month of August this year by involving actors and cricketers. Mr. Kittur says that he has taken the initiative to bring together sex workers in Bijapur district so that they can unitedly fight the spread of AIDS by way of becoming aware of safe sex practices and availing themselves of services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases."

Despite many programmes to mainstream them, people living with HIV/AIDS have to put up with denial of services and social boycott.,Now there is a ray of hope for them. Hereafter, their disease will be referred to as ‘immunodeficiency' and not as HIV/AIDS.,The Government of India has taken a decision in this regard and issued directions to various departments. This follows reservations expressed by the National AIDS Control Organisation that HIV status of an individual is a confidential information and cannot be disclosed.,There are repeated queries from agencies like insurance companies, courts and government department seeking disclosure of a person's HIV status. NACO feels HIV infection is usually not a direct cause of death, but some opportunistic infections, treatment failure and other such causes are responsible.,Therefore, it wants the death certificate of a known case should mention “Immunodeficiency” in the underlying cause column instead of HIV/AIDS.,D. Bachani, Deputy Director-General, Department of AIDS Control, has asked all the project directors of State AIDS control societies, nodal officers of ART centres and regional coordinators to follow the guidelines.,
,
,R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, A.P. State AIDS Control Society, feels the NACO decision has wider ramifications in dealing with HIV/AIDS positive persons. It is important particularly while issuing birth and death certificates.,He has written to the government to issue orders in this respect to departments like Health, Women and Child Welfare, Social Welfare, Rural Development, Panchayathi Raj, Home, Law and Department of Education.,“Dropping the discriminatory HIV tag will go a long way in minimising the social bias against the positive persons,” says Mr. Chandravadan.,Hereafter medical officers will mention immunodeficiency in place of HIV/AIDS. The same may be certified if asked by a court of law, insurance companies or any other government organisation. Till a cure is found to this disease this is considered the best option to reduce the stigma associated with PLHIVs, it is said."

Chandramouli and GFATM executive director Michel Kazatchkine.,The programmes covered under the grant agreement include Integrated Counselling and Testing Services (ICTS), Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) services and HIV-TB collaborative services.,The overall goal of the grant is to reach and diagnose an estimated 65 per cent of the HIV-infected people in India and link them to care, support and treatment services. In order to achieve this, the NACO, through this grant, aims to counsel and test 1.82 crore clients annually in over 10,700 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) by the end of the project (2012).,
,
,Special focus will be given to ante-natal women, high risk groups such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users as well as people with sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis.,The NACO also intends to work in collaboration with the National Rural Health Mission and increase the number of facility integrated ICTCs in Primary Health Centres from 1,000 to 4,755.,The number of facility integrated ICTCs under the public-private-partnership scheme in the private sector will also be increased from 266 to 1,600 by the end of the three-year period.,Of the estimated 65,000 HIV positive pregnant women in the country, the NACO will reach and identify 60 per cent of them to administer prophylactic treatment to prevent mother to child transmission under the PPTCT programme. To achieve this target, 83 lakh pregnant women will be annually counselled and tested in the ICTCs.,
,
,In the three-year period, an estimated 70 per cent of HIV-infected TB patients will be detected through an intensified package of HIV-TB collaboration services.,In addition, capacity of the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), 20 State Institutes of Health and Family Welfare and 5 National Institutes under TB programme will also be built through the establishment of an HIV unit, with requisite infrastructure and human resource strengthening. Also, cold storage units will be set up in 110 warehouses across the country to store thermolabile products such as rapid HIV diagnostic kits. Further, to improve supply chain management, a nationwide logistics management and information system will be installed.,

Dr. Vijayakumar said the rest would be settled before the end of March.,Acting Chief Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya said there were many direct and indirect links between human rights violations and the HIV epidemic. People living with HIV/AIDS were denied access to care and treatment and discriminated at workplace, sometimes fired from their jobs. “Practically, we allow them to die,” he said. They must be treated equally by society, and they should not be denied their fundamental rights.,Making suggestions to reduce stigma, he said it would be wise to start community-based HIV care programmes and adopt anti-discriminatory measures by focussing on institutions such as the workplace, hospitals and schools to prevent discrimination.,P.K. Misra, judge, Madras High Court, called for scientific, economical, sociological and legal intervention to help such people. Not only those infected, but the community must be made aware of their legal rights.,M.

,CHENNAI: Chief Secretary K.S. Sripathi on Monday launched the third phase of a new media campaign to spread awareness about ‘Nambikkai Maiyam’ or counselling and testing centres for HIV in the State.,Mr. Sripathi flagged off vans that will go from village to village in the State over the next 32 days, providing information about counselling and testing centres. Principal Secretary, Health, V.K. Subburaj, and Special Secretary, Health, S. Vijayakumar were present.,Dillu Dura is the star of the campaign, a mascot that takes the message of the need to test oneself to high-risk groups and the general population as well. Dillu Dura is the ambassador for the counselling and testing centres, now re-branded Nambikkai Maiyam.,The campaign spreads the message that those who are at risk of contracting the infection must approach one of these centres.,The campaign comprises three phases, beginning with the teaser and moving on to a direct message pointing towards the Nambikkai Maiyam. A total of Rs.1.33 crore has been allocated for the campaign, Shambu Kallolikar, project director, TANSACS, told reporters.,Currently, just over 27 lakh persons visit the centres every year, which is only two-thirds of the population estimated to be infected with HIV. “We need the remaining [from the high-risk groups] also to come for tests to the centres. They should feel comfortable about coming for a test and rest assured that confidentiality will be preserved,” he said.,The vans will cruise several districts, about 200 colleges and with the help of TANSACS partners — NGOs and positive people’s networks — convey the message, according to Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project-Voluntary Health Services."

,CHANDIGARH: “The only thing worse than being HIV+ is being an HIV+ widow,” says 26-year-old Pooja Thakur, who lost her husband, a truck driver in Punjab, to AIDS five years ago. Pooja is one of the many widows in the State who are shunned by society once they contract HIV from their husbands.,Compared to the social stigma faced by such women, the medical complications of the disease look frivolous. Apart from being considered a “bad omen” at social functions, most such women are treated as outcasts by their own families.,“My in-laws blamed me for my husband’s death and threw me and my three sons, two of whom are HIV+, out on the street. Because of the social stigma, no one provides shelter or job to an HIV+ person and the females, especially young widows, usually fall prey to sexual abuse,” says Pooja who works as president of the Chandigarh Network of Positive People (CNP+).,While a few of these women manage to find some source of employment, usually as maids by hiding their disease, many fall prey to prostitution. “I lost my husband and I was denied my right over what he left behind. Worst, for no fault of mine, I too had HIV. At first I thought of committing suicide but there was no one to look after my children, so I left the village in Fazilka and went to Ludhiana, but poverty drove me to prostitution,” rues a 26-year-old mother of two whose husband contracted the disease by sharing infected needles.,According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, over 17 per cent of HIV/AIDS cases in Punjab are caused by sharing of infected needles, the national percentage for which is barely 3 per cent.,According to the CNP+ Programme Coordinator, “The national training module for prevention of transmission of HIV to children, 2002, is flawed because there is no consideration of the socio-economic variables of rural India. All efforts of the government agencies are focused at getting photos clicked and putting up a colourful exhibition followed by lunch and tea for the guests and VIPs.”,According to a senior official of the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, over 50,000 people visited the Red Ribbon Express, a special train run to create awareness among the masses about HIV/AIDS. The official added that the Government grants widows a pension and free education to all children irrespective of their HIV status. The pension received by a widow, HIV+ or not, is Rs.250 per month, which comes once in a few months, according to Meenaj Vij, who has been HIV+ for the past 14 years.,“Though the first few years are difficult, each widow learns to live for the sake of her children. A few lucky ones have a supportive family or a job, but even the unlucky ones carry on hoping for a better future for their children,” she adds."

Authorities are introducing free distribution of second line of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) drugs from January 20 at Gandhi Hospital. The project is being launched by A.P. States AIDS Control Society (APSACS) with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and Clinton Foundation. Authorities informed that strict screening by a committee of experts would be taken up to identify patients who need this therapy.,There are 45,000 HIV positive persons receiving first line of HIV drugs in 25 ART centres since 2004 in the State. The second line treatment will be given to only those patients who are already registered in these ART centres and those who have a white card. “We are expecting 250 to 300 persons for second line treatment in the first phase. We are the third State in the country to implement this scheme. Initially, patients registered in Osmania and Gandhi Hospitals will be eligible for treatment,” said APSACS Project Director R. V. Chandravadan to media persons. Under second line of treatment, drugs worth Rs. 1 lakh per year to each patient would be supplied. Frequent tests to check for the effectiveness of the drugs would be taken up at Gandhi Hospital. Widows and children are also covered in this scheme.,“Patients who are on first line ART treatment since past two years at our ART centres but don’t have a white card are also eligible. The second line of drugs are ten times costlier than the earlier ones,” Mr. Chandravadan said. Second line regimen will have more side effects and tolerability of these drugs will be much less compared to first line drugs. “Patient has to take 7 to 9 pills per day in this regimen and have to ensure strict adherence to protocols because there is no treatment after this,” said Dr. B. Prahlad, in-charge of Gandhi Hospital’s ART centre."

,Thiruvananthapuram: The Social Welfare Department has chalked out a plan of action as part of its efforts to integrate HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support activities into various programmes of the department.,‘Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS’ is a major initiative launched by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society, seeking collaboration of various ministries, departments, corporate houses and the people’s representatives in HIV-related issues.,At a recent workshop organised to draw up the action plan for sensitising people on HIV, Usha Titus, Secretary, Social Welfare and Project Director of KSACS, said that the department would give priority to welfare issues of HIV positive people when devising programmes.,The department has taken the first step by taking up an issue central to the well-being of HIV-positive persons, that of nutrition. A scheme to give nutrition supplements to HIV-positive women and children has been approved by the government. The department has now designated a nodal person, in the rank of Joint Director, to coordinate its HIV-related activities.,The draft plan prepared at the workshop has decided to incorporate a module on HIV in all training programmes. To train the staff to be more sensitive to the issues of HIV-positive persons, the department will also develop a core group of trainers.,Another novel suggestion that the department has put forth is the development of ‘HIV-positives-friendly’ ICDS (Integrated Child Development Scheme) villages, at least one in every district. It will involve educating each ICDS village so that the community gets a clear understanding of HIV. This approach could encourage people to adopt a non-discriminatory attitude to HIV-positive persons.,KSACS is pursuing its HIV-mainstreaming efforts with other departments too. Next in line for sensitisation are the Tourism and Local Self Government departments.,The effort was launched as the authorities recognised that the response to HIV can be effective only if it goes beyond the health sector and connects to people from various sectors. Every department is being asked to identify how best they can integrate HIV prevention activities into their core area of work. The message being given out is that HIV is everyone’s business."

,Madikeri: India is the home to the third largest number of HIV positive people in the world, characterised by widespread migration and mobility, it was revealed at a sensitisation programme on HIV, AIDS, involving migrant labour at a private plantation at Galibeedu, near here.,Organisers of a sensitisation programme, Asha Kirana and HOPES Trust, on Tuesday last called upon the plantation owners in Kodagu district to extend support to the programmes to generate awareness among the labour on the pernicious effects of the disease.,More than two million Indians did not live in the place of their birth. Migrants became vulnerable owing to several reasons such as dissociation from families, and sexual partners for long. It was important to note that all migrants were at equal risk, a statement received from Asha Kirana, Mysore, and HOPES Trust, Kodagu, said on Thursday.,One such programme called Targeted intervention project in Kodagu district was held at the private plantation. It was supported by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society, in association with the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), according to a statement from the organisers.,The statement said that there were over 2,000 coffee plantations in Kodagu and there were around 40,000 migrants in the district in the coffee season, of which 70 per cent would be men.,The sensitisation programme would help analyse the perceived HIV, AIDS risk management among migrant labour. Conducting awareness programmes through the media, community participation, street plays and other means such as information and education would go a long way in mitigating the impact of HIV, AIDS.,A positive network for HIV, AIDS did not exist in Kodagu, the statement said.,Women migrants were largely at risk due to the possibility of engaging in transactional sex either through coercion or to supplement their income. As far as men were concerned, relative freedom in a new setting as well as peer pressure to experiment with new norms or distress migration driven by seasonal droughts or disasters, loneliness, drudgery were some of the reasons. The lack of HIV, AIDS awareness, information and social support network were some of the reasons that exposed the migrant workers to risk.,Jnanamani Nanaiah, district AIDS nodal officer, who inaugurated the programme, highlighted the various modes of transmission of HIV, preventive measures and facilities available from the Government.,Swamy of Asha Kirana and Arathy Somaiah of HOPES Trust spoke."

The newborn will receive Nevirapine drops from the first day of the birth up to six weeks. The baby will be tested at six weeks, six months, 12 months and 18 months.,“After 18 months, if the baby is found negative, he/she remains negative for life which means that he/she has been protected,” said Mr. Sastry.,To reduce stigma associated with HIV testing, every Primary Health Centre in the district has been made a testing centre.,Last year, of the around 48,000 antenatal women tested, 140 tested positive.

The six high-risk States had shown a declining trend.,Mr. Azad said a total of 143.8 lakh clients, including 61.2 lakh expecting mothers, were counselled at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres across the country in 2009-10.,For people with HIV-AIDS, 64 new anti retroviral therapy (ART) centres were established in the last one year and 89,000 patients were receiving free ART treatment."
A unique course in HIV care,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/A-unique-course-in-HIV-care/article15679548.ece'],)","There is an acute shortage of qualified and trained human resources in HIV care, treatment and support services in Karnataka. The anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres and community care centres for HIV patients are facing severe scarcity of doctors trained in HIV medicine.,With the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) increasing the number of community care centres and ART centres to meet the growing demand, the demand for qualified physicians has also gone up. And thanks to the rise in the number of HIV care and treatment centres in Karnataka, there is an urgent need for committed and competent physicians to manage them and ensure proper care of patients. Importantly, Karnataka is likely to have nearly 35 community care centres and 40 ART centres and the State plans to extend ART services to the level of primary health centres in a phased manner.,“HIV medicine was not a part of the curriculum at the time of training of most practising doctors. Moreover, there has been a steady progress in knowledge and practice in HIV care and treatment which required constant updating by the doctors. The opportunities for physicians to hone their knowledge and skills were limited in the absence of a detailed course in HIV medicine,” explains Dr. S. Rajendra Prasad, a senior physician trained in HIV medicine at the University of South Florida, U.S. and Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune.,Dr. Prasad says the shortage of doctors in HIV care is very high in the State and doctors are not familiar with the treatment procedures.,Taking all these factors into consideration and to address the challenges in HIV care, Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM), a voluntary social service organisation started by a group of medicos of Mysore Medical College in 1984, conceptualised the HIV fellowship course.,Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) has recognised the course and has introduced a 12-month residential course in HIV fellowship. The course, which has six-month compulsory internship, began in two institutions in the State with a maximum intake of 10 participants (for each institute) from July 1, 2009 onwards. Vivekananda Memorial Hospital, Saragur, a unit of SVYM, and Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bangalore, are the affiliated institutions for the fellowship.,“The course is said to be the country's first university-recognised fellowship in HIV medicine,” said Dr. Prasad, who works at the Vivekananda Memorial Hospital at Saragur in H.D. Kote taluk of Mysore district.,Dr. Prasad and Dr. Sudhir, who is trained at CMC, Vellore, of the hospital are the resource persons for the course at Saragur.,The fellowship aims to provide opportunity for hands-on training for acquiring proficiency in HIV management.,The full-time course equips medical professionals to adopt and practice ‘inclusive and integrated' model of HIV care services and understanding the concepts and practices of palliative care in management of chronic illnesses, according to SVYM.,Inclusive and integrated model, according to a note issued by SVYM, means bringing people infected and affected by HIV within the ambit of care without stigma and discrimination and integrating HIV care and treatment programme within the regular/general public and private health system.,The candidates will also learn research and managerial skills and the course provides opportunity for hands-on clinical and public health experience.,Candidates with MBBS or BDS degree or its equivalent recognised by the Medical Council of India and the Dental Council of India respectively and who have completed one-year compulsory rotatory internship in a teaching institution or other institution recognised by the MCI/DCI, and have obtained permanent registration of any State Medical/Dental Council are eligible for admission.,A certificate of Fellow in HIV medicine will be awarded to the candidates who successfully complete the course.,“The last date for admission to the course for this year at the Saragur hospital is November 10,” Dr. Prasad said. The course participants will be managing outpatients and inpatients in a HIV care facility having an integrated and inclusive model of care.,The fellowship course focuses on building knowledge, clinical skills, research and communication techniques and right attitude. The training prepares the physician to be a leader in HIV care, support, training and management programme, according to SVYM.,Dr. Prasad said jobs for qualified candidates will be available in HIV projects.,For further details on the fellowship, call Ms. Nandini, training coordinator, SVYM on 95914 07955."

,
,India now puts itself in the company of the United States and China that recently lifted their travel restrictions, prompting applause from PLHIV communities and human rights groups internationally, according to the Forum of Parliamentarians on HIV and AIDS (FPA).,This action was prompted by a parliamentary question on April 15, 2010, by E. M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, Rajya Sabha member and state organiser of the Forum .,
,
,The FPA is a registered organisation with the membership of Parliamentarians from all major political parties. It was started in 2002 as a bipartisan forum for steering the political response to AIDS, in partnership with UNAIDS., At the behest of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had earlier withdrawn the requirement for HIV testing of foreigners, including students. However, some Indian embassies and consulates continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. The latest move from the MEA will ensure that HIV-related questions will not be asked on any visa application forms.,
,
, Welcoming the initiative from the MEA, Oscar Fernandes, Rajya Sabha member and President, FPA, said: “I am pleased that India has clarified its position to lift HIV-related travel restrictions.”,UNAIDS Country Coordinator Charles Gilks said: “Such regulations were issued by many countries in the 1980s when little was known about HIV, and there was more of confusion and fear about the virus.”,Globally there is no evidence that such restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health.,“The MEA move upholds India's commitment to human rights and dignity of all people, including those who are living with HIV,” he added.

,An international trial, which has generated much excited anticipation, provides proof for the first time that pills used to treat HIV/AIDS can also prevent it. Campaigners greeted the results, published today in the ,, with enthusiasm, suggesting that they could fundamentally change the approach to preventing HIV in some groups of people.,The findings are good news for men who have sex with men, the population in whom the drugs were tried. There were 43.8 per cent fewer HIV infections among those who took Truvada, the once-a-day tablet containing two drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir, than among those who did not.,The protective effect was much greater in those who took the tablets consistently: The study was carried out by the independent Gladstone Institute on behalf of the US National Institutes of Health in six countries: Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.,Nearly 2,500 men and transgender women who have sex with men and were at high risk of HIV infection took part in the study which began in 2007. Half the volunteers were given Truvada and the others were given a dummy pill.,Need for consistency,But Aids experts warned gay and bisexual men and their doctors that drugs did not offer an instant and easy answer. Protection was low in those who did not take them regularly.,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States issued guidance that pre-exposure prophylaxis “should never be seen as the first line of defence against HIV”.,Men who participated in the trials were counselled to use condoms, reduce their number of sexual partners and get tested and treated for other sexually transmitted diseases which can increase the risk of HIV infection.,The big unanswered question is whether drugs can also prevent infection in other at-risk groups, such as women in sub-Saharan Africa whose partners will not use condoms, and drug users.,
,
,The study showed the pill is protective in sex between men, but it does not follow that drugs would protect during heterosexual sex, where the route of transmission is different.,Dr Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC National Centre for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, said the results “represent a major advance in HIV prevention research ... Given the heavy burden of HIV among gay and bisexual men, a new tool with potential additive benefit is exciting and welcome news.”,The findings provided hope that prophylactic drug treatment could protect other at-risk groups around the world. “Given the continued severity of the HIV epidemic, safe and effective new approaches are urgently needed for all populations at risk,” he said.

Insurance companies like Star though proactive to give policy to AIDS patients, their area of operations were very limited.,“At this point, I would like to question, when many diseases such as renal failure, kidney transplantations, heart attacks, strokes, cancers etc., have been included under insurance benefits, why AIDS patients are being discriminated against? Why are they not being covered under the super hit Arogyasri scheme'?”,Stating that it was violation of human rights of HIV/AIDS patients, he contended that the life of a person with kidney disease was not more precious than the life of a poor AIDS patient. This type of disparities and imbalances should not be a welcome feature in health sector, he pointed out.,At least the government machinery should not treat HIV/AIDS disease and AIDS patients in isolation as untouchables.,“Rather it is the responsibility of all of us in society to accept them as fellow human beings and give them an opportunity to live with dignity by getting regular ART and nutritious supplements to lead a near normal life,” he opined."

Perhaps the most vulnerable group are children with HIV/AIDS, whose number has increased by 46 per cent between 2001 and 2009. Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is possible by 2015 and WHO is committed to this goal.,On World AIDS Day, WHO calls on member-states to focus on strengthening health systems and ensuring early detection and treatment of HIV-affected persons.,Globally, an estimated 33.3 million people live with the virus, and 2.6 million were newly infected in 2009. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, 3.5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, largely in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand. In 2009, there were an estimated 2,20,000 new HIV infections in the region, and 2,30,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses.,
,
,The populations at highest risk of contracting HIV include female sex workers, homosexual men, transgender populations, and people who inject drugs. Issues of health care access, stigma and ignorance, and the imperative to prevent transmission of HIV to a new generation are central to the response to HIV/AIDS. Regionally, women constitute 37 per cent of the 3.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS, and without any intervention, about a third of infants born to HIV-positive mothers could acquire HIV.,
,
,Widespread implementation of WHO's new guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants could substantially reduce paediatric HIV and improve maternal and child survival.,In addition, greater sensitivity to the status of those living with HIV/AIDS, fighting prejudice and stigma and mainstreaming HIV/AIDS services are critical to overcoming the disease. WHO is advocating action to reduce stigma and discrimination in health care settings and communities, so that vulnerable and high-risk populations can access health care services without prejudice and fear. It is important for an individual to know of his or her HIV status and seek treatment accordingly."

The messages have gone down well, and the awareness levels have increased considerably, but the area of concern has now shifted towards stigma and its effects. This factor is playing the spoil sport in identification, treatment and care and support of the infected and the affected. It is now a challenge for us to eradicate this aspect,” said the Additional District Medical and Health Officer and District Nodal Officer for AIDS P. Rajendra Prasad.,According to him the prevalence rate and has come down significantly in almost all high risk groups like FSW (Female Sex Workers), truckers, migrant workers, mother-to-child transmission and MSM. He also informed that the use of condoms among the high risk groups have gone up appreciably.,The drop in the prevalence rate and the increase in the condom usage are mainly due to the phased BCC (Behaviour Change Communication) and IEC campaigns like the Be Bold, Aasha I and II and Mee Neestam that were run by APSACS, both individually and in collaboration with other organisations like PSI and HLFPPT. But despite the success rate, the factor of stigma still seems to haunt us and the infected, he says.,While on the one hand the percentage of HIV positive cases have come down from 16.9 per cent in 2002-03 to 5.53 per cent in 2009-10, the stigma factor has kept over 3,000 people from reaching the ART or ICTC centers.

Dr. Surya Rao also presented a paper at the conference.,He said the conditions had changed a lot from 90s when an AIDS patient would die soon but now a patient could live 42 years more (from the time he or she contacted the disease) if he or she took the medicines. The concept worldwide on prevention of AIDS and HIV were based on policy of vaginal, oral interference control epidemic (VOICE) study, by taking a tablet or applying a gel and a mathematical model showed that by 2015, the world would be free of AIDS and HIV if one got treatment as soon as he or she contacted the disease.,There are medicines to control the dreaded disease but the high cost was proving to be a burden for people in the Asian and African countries while 85 per cent of the AIDS and HIV patients were living their life full.,Dr. Surya Rao also pointed out that many were not taking the full course of medicines and stopping medication as soon as they saw some improvement.,Circumcision would help a lot in preventing the spread of AIDS and HIV, according to studies made in this area, he said.

Thirteen per cent said they would wait till a report was made on the success of the procedure and six per cent felt that the sexual pressure might drop.,Dr. Surya Rao said treatment of HIV and AIDS must be brought under Arogya Sri scheme.

,An international clinical trial has found that AIDS-fighting antiretroviral drug combinations given to pregnant and breastfeeding women in Botswana, Africa, prevented 99 per cent of the mothers from transmitting he human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to their infants.,The trial was led by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH).,“This is the lowest rate of mother-to-child transmission recorded in a study from Africa, or among breastfeeding infants,” said lead author Roger Shapiro, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health.,The mother-to-child transmission rate in the study was 1.1 per cent when the infants were breastfed to age 6 months.,“Previous interventions using shorter or less comprehensive drug treatment regimens have been unable to get rates below 5 per cent, and without any intervention, the infection rate would be at least 25 per cent by 6 months,” said Shapiro.,The study was also the first randomized clinical trial to compare highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.,The article appears today (June 17) in The ,. Breastfeeding is normally the best way to feed an infant and is one of the most critical factors for improving child survival in developing nations.,
,
,A woman infected with HIV, however, can transmit the virus to her child during breastfeeding, as well as during pregnancy, labour and delivery.,The research was part of the Mma Bana Study conducted in southern Botswana as a collaboration between HSPH and the Botswana government to improve health for women and children. The use of HAART to prevent vertical transmission is one of the most successful public health interventions to prevent the transmission of AIDS in pregnancy.,Little has been known, however, about its promise for halting HIV transmission from mother to infant through breastfeeding in areas of the world where formula feeding is neither safe nor feasible, including most of sub-Saharan Africa.,The study compared the suppression of the mother's HIV virus at delivery and throughout breastfeeding among women assigned to receive one of three treatment regimens, according to a Harvard Medical School press release.,Overall, 730 HIV-infected pregnant women were included in the study and most started HAART early in the third trimester of pregnancy. Almost all women achieved viral suppression by delivery, and their virus remained undetectable throughout breastfeeding.,All three HAART regimens consisted of commonly used antiretroviral combinations with three active drugs.,
,
,All HAART regimens used in the study were found to be highly effective at suppressing the HIV virus, said the authors. They also found the HAART regimens used in the study were safe and generally well-tolerated.,The rates of infection with HIV in southern Africa are 3 to 5 times higher than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and more than 100 times higher than in the rest of the world. This discrepancy is much greater for women and children.,The Mma Bana Study findings already have influenced WHO guidelines on the use of HAART to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. For the first time, WHO recently recommended that all HIV-infected mothers or their infants take antiretroviral drugs while breastfeeding to prevent HIV transmission."

The event was conducted exclusively for children hailing from HIV-affected families or orphans who are beneficiaries of the welfare schemes being implemented by the VMM.,“A major chunk of the participants were vulnerable children, either affected by AIDS or orphans. Nearly 180 children who had passed eighth, ninth or tenth classes, had their names enrolled in short-term courses like DTP and housekeeping, being offered under Rajiv Udyogasri programme,” said B. Keerthy, technical support manager of the VMM.,Assisted by VMM volunteers, a team of six department personnel guided the children how to fill up their application forms.

NGOs join hands for HIV palliative care,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/NGOs-join-hands-for-HIV-palliative-care/article16269708.ece'],)","The importance of giving palliative care to those living with HIV/AIDS is something that even these patients are yet to fully comprehend. As in the case of any chronic disease, palliative care has an important role in the care and support of them.,With even the National AIDS Control Organisation yet to come out with a clear policy or guidelines on this, Pallium India, a pioneer in the area of palliative care in the country, and Family Health International (FHI), an international non-governmental organisation working in the area of public health, are joining hands to develop an appropriate model of integrating palliative care with the government's HIV care programme.,Kerala's unique model of community-oriented palliative care delivery system having caught worldwide attention, a 10-member team of FHI doctors and researchers had been in the State capital for several days in May, going on field visits with Pallium India health volunteers and holding consultations with experts here.,“FHI is working in India closely with the Centre as well as the State governments on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, TB and health systems strengthening. Though HIV care has expanded much, palliative care is quite ignored, at present. But it is very important as those infected with HIV can go on to live for many years, with the burden of several opportunistic infections, which worsens as the infection progresses,” Ashok Agarwal, a project directors of FHI, said.,
,
,The role of palliative care starts right from the time HIV infection is diagnosed, when the person goes through intense psychological and social distress. Palliative care goes beyond the medical management of infectious, neurological or oncological complications of HIV/AIDS and managing the pain from side effects of drugs to addressing comprehensively the problems the patient faces through a continuum of HIV infection, Dr. Agarwal said.,In most parts of the country, even the medical fraternity is yet to comprehend that palliative care is not just terminal care. Many doctors still have only a vague idea about palliative care and are not knowledgeable or trained to use morphine for pain management.,“Pain is not taken into account in HIV care. It could be the side effects of anti-retroviral therapy or co-morbidities or it could be discomfort of diarrhoea, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness, fatigue and confusion, some of the many symptoms of HIV. But even people living with HIV just suffer this silently, thinking that it is ‘normal,'” M.R. Rajagopal, chairman of Pallium India, said.,“We will take up the task of advocacy so that a national policy on the palliative care component in HIV care and support can be evolved and made a part of our national programme,” Dr. Agarwal said."

With the help of a social organisation, Manav Adhikar Surakhya Manch (MASM), he has approached the State Human Rights Commissioner and the Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC), southern division, for intervention so that he could get proper treatment.,According to Abani Gaya of MASM the condition of the patient is critical. The HIV positive patient hails from Kashipur block in Rayagada district. He also suffers from leprosy. His HIV infection has added to the woes. The patient has alleged that he is not getting proper care and attention due to his HIV status. Although it is too hard for him to walk around, yet no wheel chair has been provided to him. Yet he is being directed by doctors to visit different sections of the hospital to get different tests done, he alleges.,The HIV positive man has also alleged that his scheduled operation is being intentionally delayed.,The Superintendent of the medical college during his interaction with the MASM activists has stated that the date for his operation will be fixed with the arrangement of proper amount of blood of A+ group needed by the patient.,Regional coordinator of the Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS) Loknath Mishra has said they have also received information about the HIV positive patient admitted in the medical college hospital. “We are making all possible efforts so that he could get all possible medical help without any discrimination due to his HIV status,” he says."
South Africa's HIV carer children,"(['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/South-Africas-HIV-carer-children/article16262512.ece'],)","AFRICAN REALITY: Residents look at HIV/AIDS awareness literature during a soccer match in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. — PHOTO: AFP
 
,Not far from the manicured South African pitches where millionaire footballers are capturing the world's attention, Oxford academics are working with local researchers to investigate an African reality that will linger long after the World Cup circus has left. Interviewing more than 7,000 people in some of the country's poorest townships, they are studying the mental health and education of a generation of South African children who are growing up caring for relatives with HIV and Aids.,This is the Young Carers South Africa project, a collaboration between Oxford University, the South African government, and three South African universities, as well as a host of NGOs. The two-year study, involving 35 field staff, including local managers, interviewers and volunteers, is working to build a huge pool of data that will inform social policy not only for South Africa, but for other countries with high rates of AIDS and HIV around the world.,The project is spearheaded by Lucie Cluver, of Oxford's department of social policy and social work, whose inspiration was her PhD research — a study of 1,000 children who had been orphaned by Aids. She discovered that the children suffered higher levels of psychological distress than orphans whose parents had died of other causes, and were also more likely to contract HIV themselves. To raise awareness of the findings, Cluver sent her research to a South African professor, who introduced her to the government's then minister of social development, Zola Skweyiya. The next day he called her to a meeting and said her research “needed to become a national study”, Cluver says.,Two years on, the Young Carers project now has teams in three South African provinces, interviewing 6,000 children and 1,500 of their parents or guardians about their access to social welfare grants, health visitors, and free school meals. With the help of local teenagers, they have made questionnaires that also ask about issues such as stigma and bullying, social support, parent-child relationships and carers' access to anti-retroviral medicine.,“We interview children face-to-face, somewhere private — at home, at school, sometimes in the yard,” says Cluver, “even though some of the sites are only accessible by tiny 20-seater planes or 4x4 vehicles. The interviews are amazing — the kids are often so happy to have someone to talk to about the secret illness in their family. What's difficult is the circumstances in which they live. We've worked through taxi wars and riots in Cape Town, gangsters in Durban, and cholera outbreaks in Mpumalanga. Our researchers walk through open sewers and over rubbish heaps, into homes which desperately poor people keep spotlessly clean.”,Shockingly, so far, the research suggests children who live with AIDS-sufferers have as much psychological distress as those who have been orphaned by AIDS. “It's because of the stigma that comes with having HIV in the family,” Cluver says. “Kids report being gossiped about, and teased, and having people scared to touch them.” The early findings show that about 40 per cent of kids in AIDS-sick homes are missing or have dropped out of school, compared to 22 per cent in homes affected by other illnesses, and 5 per cent in healthy homes. Almost a third of the young carers — sometimes as young as eight — report carrying out intimate care, such as washing sick people, helping them go to the toilet and cleaning their wounds.,“The kids aren't passive victims — they're kids just like all others, wanting to be Beyonce or Usher. They're so excited about the World Cup that when they chose pseudonyms for their stories to be reported in our research, half of them used football players' names,” Cluver says.,“They worry about the same things as first-world kids — one 13-year-old girl cried throughout her interview because kids at school were calling her ‘baboon face'” But when these children get home, “they wash blankets, feed younger siblings, rub the backs of people with tuberculosis, make sure their parents take their anti-retrovirals, miss school for hospital trips, and queue to get medication for their carers who are too sick to stand,” Cluver reports. “When they get to school they're so worried about the sick person at home that they can't concentrate.” More children will face this situation. In 2008, 1.4 million South African children had lost a parent to HIV/AIDS; that's expected to rise above two million by 2015. When I ask Cluver what she hopes to be the impact of her study, her response is passionate: “We don't hope — we'll make something happen: this study is science to serve policy.” The researchers are already giving regular updates to the South African government as well as NGOs such as USAID, Unicef and Child Welfare South Africa. They hold community meetings, and speak to schools, social workers and hospital staff about the issues the kids are raising, and how best to support them. “We're also making two movies — directed, filmed and edited by the kids and their carers — to deal with the stigma surrounding Aids,” says Cluver.,The study aims to reveal the scale of the difficulties faced by HIV/AIDS-affected families. “There has been no large-scale research in the developing world to understand how much work these kids are taking on in the home, and the effects,” Cluver says. “We need to understand if these kids are more depressed, traumatised or anxious than other children, and whether they are struggling at school. We need to know if they're unable to access health services, or are catching illnesses like TB from people they're looking after. Then, we need to know what can help them.” Both the South African government and NGOs are eager for the findings, Cluver says, in order to adapt their policies to help these children. She is hopeful about the study's impact, but admits that in the meantime, the researchers feel powerless.,One 13-year-old told of just folding his arms at lunchtime at school, “because we don't have money to buy food now that my mother cannot work”. An 11-year-old girl described pushing her mum to the clinic in a wheelbarrow, and “bringing her a glass of water because she cannot get out of bed”.,“The parents tell our researchers about horrific experiences and expect to receive help for their situation, but all we can do is give them a biscuit and a certificate. There's nothing we can do but research,” says Cluver. “It's hard to face families who have shared their life stories and then have to walk out of the door.” ,

It is mostly the private practitioners who are putting the patients directly on the second line regimen in contravention of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) guidelines.,Following a public interest litigation, the Supreme Court has directed all private practitioners, hospitals and clinics who are providing the ART to furnish information about patients seeking treatment from them in a prescribed quarterly reporting format. The apex court has called for submission of updated information as on September 30 by October 18.,The NACO too has set out clear guidelines for rational use of ART especially in the private sector. Any irrational use of ART or deviation from the national protocol will be viewed seriously as a ‘professional misconduct', it warned. Most drug companies are pushing for expensive combination of drugs, though not required. The second line of treatment cost Rs. 1 lakh per annum while the first line of treatment comes for just Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 10,000. More than 60 per cent of AIDS patients in Andhra Pradesh are accessing treatment through private practitioners who do not follow the guidelines. “We will try to wean them away to the government ART centres”, said R.V. Chandravadan, project director, APSACS.,He said NACO wanted patient's financial condition to be assessed since ART was a lifelong therapy with significant economic burden. Referring all PLHA to government ART centres will help save resources for good nutrition and other family needs. This will also make them eligible for free second line ART. The State AIDS Control Societies are asked to ensure that initial ART prescriptions must be first line regimen only. The second line ART should be resorted to only in case of proven first line failure.

As children grow into adults, it is a time for concern for parents, particularly those whose children have tested positive for HIV. The family comes together to work out strategies to break the bad news.,This is a common dilemma almost every household faces today. Until the children are grown and not on anti-retroviral drugs, they face no worry or discrimination, but once the sexually active age is reached, things become difficult.,With the HIV infection having spread into the community, through the exchange or re-use of infected syringes and the unsafe sexual practices that have infected many women, now, the large number of children infected or affected by HIV poses a serious challenge to society as well as government.,Rough estimates suggest that Manipur has 6,500 children who are affected (orphaned or abandoned with their mothers by families due to the stigma attached with HIV) by the killer infection. Taking up the challenges, several non-governmental organisations have come forward to take care of these children by providing help with treatment and education.,The Manipur Network of Positive People (MNP +) started its education support to children infected and affected with HIV/AIDS in January last year. The initiative began with 44 children of Classes I to XII, who would otherwise have dropped out as their parents had little or no earning, besides having spent most of their savings on treatment.,Today, the programme supports 93 children and covers all nine districts in the State. Imphal West has 11, Imphal East 14. Bishnupur 15, Thoubal 10, Ukhrul 10, Senapati 10, Tamenglong 3, Chandel 10 and Churachandpur 10 such children enrolled in various schools.,The programme prioritises children who are infected and orphaned, infected and with a single parent, in addition to organising home visits to assess the beneficiaries. “MNP + intends to continue the support until such time that government education schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and others incorporate children affected by HIV and AIDS and are effectively implemented in the State,” Deepak, president of MNP + told ,. The MNP + has a tie-up with some local hospitals where these children are generally referred to. With awareness about the programme spreading, many individuals and philanthropic organisations have also started chipping in.,Another non-governmental organisation, Catholic Relief Service is providing education support to 210 affected children. Under the programme, children are provided Rs. 500 for admission, Rs. 700 for school uniform, textbooks and a set of exercise books, and a monthly school tuition fee of Rs. 100.,Even as the State and society struggle to rehabilitate children with HIV and AIDS, they are confronted with the yet other challenge of Hepatitis C, which has assumed epidemic proportions.,According to the Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment conducted by the ICMR and Family Health International in two Manipur districts — Bishnupur and Churachandpur — the prevalence of the Hepatitis C virus was alarmingly high among the injecting drug-users."

The experience of an aggressive anti-AIDS campaign in five cities in the United States was that counselling was more effective in checking the spread of AIDS than advertising and other means. This was because human beings play a very key role in the spread of the disease. Socio-economic conditions that were prevalent were also playing a big role in the spread of the disease.,He said in these five major cities counselling was being used as the primary tool of checking the spread of the disease, giving less priority to advertisement campaigns and messaging.,He called for a coordinated effort between government and non-government organisations to check the spread of HIV and AIDS. He stressed the need for special programmes for the education of people in professions that were prone to contracting AIDS.

,About half of the cases of HIV/AIDS now fell under the category of home-based sex, and the number of patients in the age group of 16-43 was on the rise. These were some of the issues of concern and the need of the hour was to take up behavioural change activities to tackle the problem, said R.V. Chandravadan, Project Director, Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society, here on Saturday.,Addressing a training session for media resource persons organised by the Centre for Advocacy and Research at Hotel Ilapuram, Mr. Chandravadan said that the scenario of HIV/AIDS spreading mainly through sex workers was changing and home-based sex was now the main contributor. HIV/AIDS could no longer be treated merely as health issue, as it became a social issue. This required multi-sectoral efforts to be intensified. Unprotected sex too continued to remain a challenge, he noted.,Addressing the 34th national seminar of the Indian Association for the Study of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS (IASSTD & AIDS) at The Gateway Hotel, Mr. Chandravadan said that the number of AIDS patients and sex workers in cities like Vijayawada and Guntur was high and any number of initiatives the government was taking was proving insufficient.,Pointing out that HIV/AIDS was posing a challenge to the field of medicine, he called upon the medical fraternity to take up this challenge and work relentlessly to control it. He felt that the government needed to augment its efforts, especially by releasing more funds.,Mr. Chandravadan expressed concern over disinclination of people affected by HIV as well as sex workers to approach doctors because of the social stigma. He admitted to have come across reports of government doctors looking down upon HIV patients and speaking to them in a contemptuous manner. This was forcing them to approach quacks and unqualified doctors. In some cases, non-availability of qualified physician too was a reason for patients to approach quacks, he said."

Current treatments only delay the development of the disease and make it more manageable. If treatment is halted, however, or the virus develops immunity to the cocktail of drugs now used, it can begin infecting new cells.,The new treatment fights HIV by causing infected cells to self-destruct. When the AIDS virus infects a cell, its DNA penetrates the cell, which then manufactures new HIV viruses that infect neighbouring cells.,Dr. Abraham Loyter of HUJ explains that with the treatment, peptides, or segments of short proteins that the scientists developed, interfere with the HIV virus's replication of its genetic material, by transmitting a massive number of replications of the genetic material into the infected cell, triggering its self-destruction.,“The usual medications kill the virus that has entered the body during infection, and the [peptide] treatment allows cells infected with the genetic load of the virus to be killed,” Loyter said..,The study by Loyter, Prof. Assaf Friedler, Dr. Aviad Levin, and Dr. Zvi Hayouka, examined the effectiveness of the new treatment on the HIV-1 virus, which is the predominant cause of AIDS in developing nations.,

Patients availing HIV treatment at Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres in the Capital are also complaining about inordinate delay and irregularities in issuing ‘Sahara' cards, which makes them eligible to avail benefits like travel concessions and priority in housing schemes.,“In 2008, the government announced a pension of Rs. 250 per month. That promise is yet to be implemented. They have not even issued Sahara cards. I am taking ART treatment for HIV since last year,” complained a commercial sex worker (CSW). More such grievances poured in during a community event organised here on Saturday. Nearly 300 CSWs and a few MSMs (men who have sex with men) took part in the event to discuss such issues.,Challenges,Most of the CSWs maintained that police harassment and lack of health insurance cover for HIV infected are two major challenges faced by them. “In such meetings, we try to promote use of female condoms and precautions to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Pensions are very important for HIV infected CSWs who are finding it hard to eke out a living,” says Jyothi, president of Mahila Abhivrudhi Sangham (MAS), the NGO which organised the event. Several CSWs, while speaking in the event, also demanded that authorities issue ration cards and include their names in the voters list. “The authorities had promised to provide houses for HIV positive CSWs. When will they fulfil these promises? They are not even issuing us Sahara cards for us to be eligible for such benefits,” several of them complained. The CSWs complained about police harassment to East Zone ACP, Narayana, who was the chief guest. “He asked us to call him directly in case we are harassed again. We are also requesting authorities to issue Sahara cards and provide pensions to our members,” Jyothi demanded. The event was organised by MAS in collaboration with another NGO, Integrated Rural Development Services (IRDS)."

But 2008 saw a huge reversal, with only 39 cases reported and the number further came down to 27 in 2009.,Media reporting on stigma and discrimination helped in ensuring accountability and fixing responsibility in 75 incidents, senior officials and decision-makers intervened in six cases and in one case, a sarpanch addressed the issue of social boycott of a HIV-positive person. Officials provided care and support, took care of medical expenses and ensured a dignified burial to a patient. .,According to the survey, of 109 cases of stigma and discrimination reported from societal settings, at least 71 were reported from within families, particularly in rural households, women in the reproductive age group accounting for 60 per cent of such cases.,In the health care sector, government hospitals in major cities like Chennai and Hyderabad reported discrimination in 90 per cent of the cases, and 60 per cent were denied treatment when they needed invasive treatment.

The idea is that the pro-active role of female sex workers as a Community Based Organisation (CBO) will certainly make them more responsive to the TI programmes and make them take up the responsibility of HIV prevention,However, mobilisation and empowerment of female sex workers is easily said than done. Many previous attempts to mobilise them into a well-functioning community group has been disappointing,However, the success story of ‘Santhwanatheeram', a community-based organisation of female sex workers, promoted by Jawahar Suraksha Project in Alappuzha, a TI project of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society, in getting together female sex workers and generating in them a sense of responsibility towards HIV prevention and control is an example worthy of replication .,Santhwanatheeram has initiated several programmes to bring together the female sex workers and encourage them to stand united as a community. But it was the process of election to choose the office-bearers of the organisation, which actually brought its members close together. The project utilised the election process as a strategy to mobilise the women and encourage them to come under an umbrella.,The women were encouraged to engage in a healthy competition and to stand for the general body elections. The process resulted in bringing more such women, who were hitherto remaining invisible, into the organisation.,Familiarising them with the democratic election process itself , including declaration of dates for nomination, withdrawal of nomination and canvassing the voters through direct or indirect interaction by candidates, release of election manifesto by panel of candidates etc. served as a capacity-building exercise. Besides, the women had opportunities for public speaking and a platform for leading advocacy.,The members of Santhwanatheeram today are committed workers for the TI projects of the KSACS. They participate in all regular HIV prevention campaigns and are totally committed to the cause they are promoting."

It overturned a 149-year-old British colonial law, which described sex between members of the same gender as an “unnatural offence.” While larger democracies like India have decriminalised same gender sex and USA and China have removed travel restrictions on HIV positive people, there is growing concern over new “restrictive” legislations on HIV being enacted in 15 countries, including Uganda and some countries in Africa. At present 52 countries have travel restrictions on HIV positive people. This includes India also. The Commission, announced last month, has an 18-month term and will submit its report in December 2011. It will pick up some of the most challenging legal and human rights issues in the context of HIV, including criminalisation of HIV transmission and behaviours and practices such as drug use, sex work and consensual adult same sex relations. “We will also take up women-related issues like marital rape, domestic violence and access to drugs and availability and patenting of generic drugs, though the focus will be on HIV,” Mr Rao said.,The Commission will have three meetings but will be supported by two inter-linked processes: regional hearings (to provide an interface between the Commission and stakeholders) and a Technical Advisory Group (to advise the Commission on key research and inform it on findings and recommendations).

,District in-charge and Minor Irrigation Minister has said that one of the major reasons for the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS cases in Mudhol and Jamkhandi taluks of Bagalkot district is because people hesitate to approach doctors for getting medical treatment.,Mr. Karjol was speaking after inaugurating a ‘Mane Manege Mahiti', a door-to-door campaign launched to spread awareness on HIV/AIDS. The district administration, zilla panchayat and the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) had jointly organised the programme here on Monday.,He said that HIV positive people can lead normal lives if they get proper medical treatment and advice on how to prevent spread of the disease. He said sportsperson and film personalities have been involved in the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and the Government wants to make the campaign a successful one.,Mr. Karjol said that it was necessary that people with HIV/AIDS are treated with dignity and humanity. He said that doctors play a vital role in helping people with HIV/AIDS remain in the mainstream. The doctors should not refuse to treat the patients as it will demoralise them and they will hesitate further to approach a doctor for advice and treatment.,Actor Pooja Gandhi, who participated in the door-to-door campaign, called upon the people to understand the reasons for the spread of HIV/AIDS. People who have contracted the disease should adopt a positive approach to life, she added.,Speaking on the objectives of the programme, KSAPS trainer Shashidhar explained how interventions was successful among the female sex workers, men having sex with men (MSM) and migrants but felt that a lot of work needs to be done to prevent spread of the virus among bridge population like clients of sex workers. He spoke on how important it was for pregnant women to get themselves tested for HIV/AIDS. He said only a small section of the population was making use of the free treatment available for preventing the spread of the disease from mother to child.,Although every primary health centre offers free medical treatment, a small section of pregnant women make use of it, he said.,A procession was taken out by ASHA workers and NSS cadets.

Reason: unavailability of testing kits.,Testing has come to a halt in the past 10 days in all government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC), including Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore. A few centres that still have the kits are testing only emergency cases. This when the State testing centres need at least 4,000 kits a month.,“Many patients are upset. They shout at us and ask us if they have to use a politician's influence,” said V. Prakash, counsellor at Bowring Hospital's ICTC.,“There is shortage across the State. There are 565 ICTCs for the HIV-affected where they are tested for free,” said Fayaz Ahmed, an HIV/AIDS counsellor in an ICTC in Ramanagaram.,Testing kits are crucial because the calculated projection of the number of HIV-infected in the State this year is 2.75 lakh, say activists.,“Only about 1.4 lakh people have been tested at the ICTCs from 2002 till date. Many who suspect they have the disease come only reluctantly for testing. The shortage forces their being turned away, and 80 per cent never turn up again,” said an HIV activist.,“Each of the 565 centres has to test 500 cases every month and we were meeting at least half the target on an average. Now even that is not possible,” he said.,The shortage has badly hit the northern districts of Bijapur, Belgaum and Bagalkot. In the case of Mysore, people have been getting themselves tested in private hospitals for the past two months. Though the shortage has not affected private hospitals, many people in the poorer bracket cannot afford testing in these private laboratories.,M.B. Rudrappa, Joint Director of the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS), acknowledged the delay in supply of kits from NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) this month. “It is not an emergency or an epidemic. People can be asked to come back later,” he said.,But counsellors are sceptical as there has been a shortage on and off for the past two months."

Rs. 400.
 
,Ramya Kannan,Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may have travelled a long way from the time myths and ill-formed notions about it fuelled a strong prejudice. But new myths keep surfacing every other day. What really drives the response to HIV/AIDS is a complex web of politically-motivated concerns.,It is this web that the Boler and Archer's book tries to map, highlighting the intricate network of political motivations that determine the way prevention, education, and support services are offered in countries hardest hit by the epidemic. And the authors do it pretty well, critically, without humming and hawing, and citing real-life situations in support. Here, then, is an open and honest book, from which nations will do well to draw lessons.,
,
,The authors are both with ActionAid. Tania Boler is a specialist in HIV and education who also did a stint with the United Nations. And David Archer is an acknowledged expert in international education. They put their heads and vast experience together to analyse how HIV prevention has “slipped down the international agenda and [how] meaningful attempts to tackle it are hampered by religious ideology and power struggles.”,“None of the children knew what AIDS was — but they knew it was bad.” Young Somchai (in Thailand) introduces the seldom noticed, but significant, component of discrimination at school. Orphaned because of AIDS, Somchai now has access to treatment, thanks to a local NGO, but is still not at school and has no idea that he is positive too. Where the lack of education co-exists with stigma, poverty and patriarchy, there seems to be little chance of making any headway.,
,
,However, the authors make it clear that, in the midst of all the HIV-wrought havoc and despair, education serves as a beacon of hope. The reasoning is simple: “Simply staying at school means that young children are in a better position to protect themselves from HIV.” Education has managed to provide African girls with the power to make sexual choices that prevent HIV infection.,From India, Africa, Thailand, and even the United Kingdom, voices speak of poverty, inadequate infrastructure, stigma, loneliness, want of political will, and, in some cases, genuine helplessness to face the onslaught of the HIV and the complex political whirl it unleashes.,South Africa's response to AIDS (under the leadership of Mbeki) comes under heavy fire. For a nation that, in 2007 had the most number of people with HIV infection, the government's response was obtuse, dilatory, and negligent.,The United States, under President George Bush, advocated abstinence and fidelity more than any other form of prevention. These messages inspired by religious right wing groups were spread across the world through PEPFAR funding. The authors, citing examples, show how they were — in several cases, based on inaccurate data — born out of fear, and caused serious damage to the condom promotion programme.,Boler and Archer refer to the huge funding the low and middle income countries get and argue that, if in spite of it, they have not responded well enough the reason is traceable to some basic problems in the way the assistance is provided. Sub-Saharan Africa, despite its heavy load, receives little international aid; and the money that comes is accompanied by conditionalities that are difficult to comply with.,
,
,There are, as must indeed be, positive stories too. In contrast to Somchai, there is Kwanjai, close to Chiang Mai, in Thailand; Brazil, where an active civil society and an early and serious investment in anti-retro virals helped tremendously with the country's response; and South Africa's Soul Buddyz, a highly popular national soap about HIV/AIDS that has made a difference to the youth;,Peppered right through with examples from real life situations, , has its readability enhanced by combining the story-telling mode and facts. To quote Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Boler and Archer “have given us a wonderful investigation of the ways and means of fighting the spread of AIDS through the expansion of education: better schooling, enhancement of public knowledge, and understanding of science.”"

,VISAKHAPATNAM: Noted physician Kutikuppala Surya Rao says that the life expectancy of people living with HIV goes up significantly due to combination of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).,Quoting success stories from various parts of the world, he said it is a matter of reassurance that combination ART continues to increase in life expectancy for patients in high-income countries. Those who are rich and who can afford combination therapy and who start as early as possible have significant life expectancy according to recent studies.,Dr. Rao, a recipient of Padma Sri, says that he conducted a study at his hospital in Kancharapalem and kept 340 positive patients for three years from November 2006 to December 2009 under observation. All the patients were given combination therapy and started as soon as they were confirmed HIV positive. As many as 314 (92 per cent) have been doing well.,“The ART Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) is a multinational cohort study of antiretroviral-naive HIV-positive patients initiating combination antiretroviral therapy,” which obviously makes a big difference. Of course patients who initiate HAART may stop, there are discordances in CD4 count increases, some keep viral load undetectable and some don’t, lifestyle matters including exercise, diet, smoking etc,” he states quoting reports from based on studies.,Dr. Rao says as per studies done worldwide, life expectancy is lower in patients with lower baseline CD4 cell counts than in those with higher baseline counts.,He is of the opinion that ART should be given early. Waiting to complete opportunistic infections treatment before initiating ART appears to be associated with a higher risk of AIDS-related disease progression and /or death without any significant benefit in terms of safety or virological response.,Studies show that there is a significant difference favouring the early treatment group in the secondary outcome of AIDS progression/death. The impact is seen primarily on morbidity and mortality events in the first six months."

It is time we, along with government, act before the situation turns similar to Africa,” he said. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS was a major barrier to encourage public participation for the cause. “Rural population, in fact, seems to have a better awareness than urban people as a lot of awareness activities are happening in villages. But yet, people are not ready for a complete acceptance.”,The ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya? initiative will embolden more corporates, including insurance companies, and NGOs to come forward to support children with HIV.

While welcoming the State’s move, members of positive networks are wondering if this will act as the much-needed bridge between ghettoisation and inclusion.,The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, along with AIDS Prevention and Control Project, Voluntary Health Services and Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative, is implementing a comprehensive master health check-up scheme for the high-risk group. The core group consists of female sex workers, men having sex with men and transgenders and will cover about 85,000 people and their families in the State.,“Providing comprehensive care is a step towards reducing stigma and discrimination within the hospital set-up because positive people usually tend to go to sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics only. This is to say we care for them and to ensure that they get care across all departments,” says V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health. The programme also anticipates upgrading of STI clinics within the government set-up and also training of staff in government hospitals, including nurses, counsellors, lab technicians and non-governmental organisation staff who will serve as a bridge between hospitals and positive persons. The services will be provided free and available under one roof. The drugs, thereafter, will be provided by the National AIDS Control Organisation, according to S.Vijayakumar, project director, TANSACS.,Rama Pandian, founder, Tamil Nadu Network of Positive Persons, brings up the issue of mainstreaming again. “No doubt this is a good initiative, and has received wide acceptance among the positive community. But if we have to go to the STI clinics again, it will lead to isolation. Bring it into the main hospital services.”"

,TIRUPATI: As usual, the ubiquitous Red Ribbon made its presence felt across the district on ‘World AIDS Day’, which was observed in the form of awareness rallies, public meetings and quiz competitions.,The flurry of activities reached a sluggish pace by midday and came to a grinding halt by the lunch session and there was hardly any event in the evening reminiscent of forenoon’s message. Yet another customary event passed with the slogan-shouting medicos and placard-holding NGO members listening to the sermons given by the elite of the town on ‘keeping away from vices’.,The message for the year ‘Universal access to human rights – prevention, care and support’ still appears a far cry. While the general awareness on HIV/AIDS has increased to an appreciable level, the number of infection cases, on the contrary, is still on the rise. Piling of equipment to treat patients does not appear to be match with the quality of counselling provided. Stigma and differential treatment are still present, though in subtle forms viz., poor accessibility to general healthcare, non-integration of HIV with general healthcare and the absence of a comprehensive palliative care policy for HIV.,
,
,The recent death of a woman at SV Ramnarain Ruia Government General Hospital (SVRRGGH) mirrors the state of apathy. The destitute woman, apparently a HIV positive widow, was reportedly found dead at the entrance of the out-patient wing, with no medical professional or sanitary worker coming to her rescue. The OP bills as well as the Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) drugs in her possession might have indicated her ‘HIV status’ to the passers-by, forcing them to turn their eyes away.,“There is no dignity even in death. Our members rushed to the spot to help her, only to find her dead by then”, says R. Meera, secretary of Women’s Initiative (WINS), a voluntary organisation working for the welfare of HIV positive and sex workers.,She scowls at the level of indifference among the doctors who confine to testing and ignore the more-important aspect, counselling, to help the unsuspecting victims.,Looking beyond awareness rallies and lectures, the policy-makers are expected to take steps to remove the stigma.,

,Kozhikode: The shortage of beds at the ward for AIDS patients at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and the lack of government initiative to rehabilitate these patients continue to cause hardships for ‘Persons Living With HIV/AIDS’ (PLWHA) in the district.,Patients complain that though December 1 is remembered as World Aids Day, little is done by the government or society to understand their living conditions, with focus being given to disease awareness, prevention and control.,Government organisations offering services to the PLWHA community exist like ‘Jyothis’ which conducts free HIV tests; ‘Ushus’ also known as Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre where ART drugs are distributed; ‘Sneha’ to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy; ‘Pulari’ - a treatment centre for sexually transmitted diseases; and Prathyasha - a service agency serving as peer counselling centre.,However, activists working with AIDS patients say that a number of components are missing in the government’s AIDS policy. A government initiative to help these patients by providing free rations and find jobs and a rehabilitation centre for patients thrown out of homes to stay permanently are some of the demands that, they say, have been continuously placed before lawmakers.,P. Kumar, vice-president of the Council of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Kerala (CPK+) and a volunteer at the Kozhikode Medical College ward and the ART Centre, said improvements had been made in availability of treatment and distribution of medicines.,“But the lack of permanent doctors at the ward and the relegation of these patients from ward 26, which could house 40 patients, to ward 43 which has just eight beds have affected treatment facilities,” Mr.Kumar said.,Prathyasha counsels more than 275 AIDS patients, most of whom are destitute. They approach the staff at the centre with requests for money, food and jobs besides counselling but the government only foots the rent bill and the salary for the staff.,The centre helps them through food kits sponsored by NGOs like the Centre for Overall Development, Thamarassery.,Mr. Kumar said there could be more HIV patients in north Kerala beyond the 3,000 registered at the ART centre. Many keep the knowledge of the illness secret for fear of ostracisation, some are ignorant that they carry the illness while others are affluent enough to seek treatment at private hospitals.,“Most AIDS patients live lonely, fearful lives. Coming to a centre like Prathyasha opens them to others who face the same problems, yet get emotional and physical support to lead normal lives. The government should launch more outreach services for HIV affected persons through Prathyasha centres,” Mr. Kumar said."

,MYSORE: If 22-year-old Seema (name changed) is today a picture of confidence and hope, then kudos to counsellors and doctors at Asha Kirana. Seema after being in and out of government and private hospitals and after wrongly being diagnosed with malaria and typhoid came to Asha Kirana.,There, it was confirmed that she was HIV positive and had tuberculosis. Over the past 20 days, Seema has shown signs of recovery thanks to the medicines and care by the staff and her mother.,“Only my daughter and I know about positive status. If we tell our relatives or people in our village they may ostracise us, as they are not aware of the fact that the disease won’t spread through contact or communication boycott. We’ll just tell them that she has TB,” says Seema’s mother.,What makes matters worse is that Seema has been deserted by her husband. After two miscarriages, her husband left home. “I was married off when I was 12 to my mother’s brother. My father felt that he was dying and wanted to see me settled. My husband was very fond of me, but now…” says Seema wiping away tears. Her mother now suspects that her brother knew that he was positive, but hid it from them. “He worked in Kalasipalya in Bangalore as a daily wage earner and he probably had physical relationships with women there. My daughter is suffering on account of his misdeeds. HIV/AIDS is not something that the poor should get; it’s among the biggest curses on the poor,” she says.,One relief, she continues, is that it is not too late still. “We did find out at the right time and there is still hope of recovery. Asha Kirana has offered to get her remarried or even get her placed with some company. Awareness about the disease and access to care becomes crucial in such cases and we wish many more initiatives are launched. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS should be removed,” says Seema’s mother.,Going by this incident , this year’s theme for World AIDS Day, “Universal Access and Human Rights”, cannot be more apt.,Says Dr. Mothi of Asha Kirana: “WHO had devised a 3/5 plan, according to which 3 million people with HIV/AIDS were to have had universal access by the end of 2005. But despite the availability of money, medicines and manpower this could not be achieved because of lack of awareness. So through this campaign we will all have to work towards creating a comfortable atmosphere where people can come and access care; bringing attitudinal change becomes important.”,Originating as a counselling-cum-care clinic for people living with AIDS (PLWA) in 1997, Asha Kirana has now evolved into a major referral centre in the State. Asha Kirana is the first specialised hospital-cum-research institute for HIV/AIDS, the first to offer subsidised HIV testing and free antiretroviral therapy to children with AIDS, the first voluntary counselling centre, the first healthcare facility to launch outreach programmes in rural and urban areas and the first day-care clinic for PLWA in Mysore region."

Improved infrastructure for ART centres and installation of new CD4 machines is also on the cards, participants at the meeting organised by TANSACS said on Tuesday.,Earlier, on Tuesday, at a meeting organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, V.K.

One of the key areas that public-private-partnership (PPP) is required is in the area of dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At the session, ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way,’ Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals – Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K.

America’s approach to visas had also evolved dramatically, as legislation had enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K.

,TIRUCHI: The Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS is in the process of forming women’s and men’s self-help groups at the level of taluks.,Formation of men and women SHGs constituting HIV positive members has already been completed in Thuriayur and Musiri, and a women SHG has been formed in Tiruchi.,“We are currently into the task of forming a men SHG in Tiruchi, and women and men SHGs in Lalgudi,” said M. Vijayalakshmi, president of the Tiruchi district network of people living with HIV/AIDS.,Since most of the HIV affected people are shunned by their families and the society, economic emancipation through income generation activities was the purpose behind formation of the SHGs, under the Global Fund Round 4 Access to Care and Treatment (ACT) Project, according to Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,Each group constitutes 12 members and is not an SHG in the real sense of the term. In this case, the members are not required to make any monetary contribution for sustaining membership. The idea is to create a base for seeking the support of the government departments in the form of skills training and self-employment support.,At a recent convention, the members of the network pleaded for their inclusion for the skill- training programmes and self-employment assistance under the schemes of Social Welfare Department, Mahalir Thittam and Thadco.,They have enough reasons to feel that they are cared for by the government machinery. The support of the district administration in expediting the process of widow pension for the HIV affected women has been a cause for immense relief for the network members. HIV patients are also being provided with excellent treatment at the Annal Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital.,“Our concern is that the wrong notion of HIV affliction still persists among the people despite the fact that several widows among the HIV affected members were innocent victims. What we now look for is long-term support through exclusive government schemes directed at economic progress of HIV affected people,” said Ms. Vijayalakshmi.,
,
,To begin with, measures like issue of free house pattas to HIV affected people, priority in issuance of the various certificates, distribution of educational materials to children, marketing support for products developed by them, and inclusion of HIV/AIDS patients under the Chief Minister’s Insurance Scheme for Life Saving Procedures will go a long way in infusing confidence, according to the members of the network, which has been mobilising resources through sponsors to meet the educational expenses of the younger generation."

The films ‘Life…,’ ‘Love…’ and ‘Hope…,’ made by Kiruthiga Udayanidhi, and directors M.Sasikumar and Mysskin reflect the social isolation of HIV-affected children. People AIDS Initiative, in association with Alaihal Midea and Red Giant Movies had produced the films.,Describing the discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS as “new untouchability,” actor Kamal Haasan said filmmakers have a major role to sensitise the society to the need for social acceptance of such people. On his association with the Population Services International and Hello FM initiative ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya?,’ a month-long campaign in support of HIV-positive children, Mr. Haasan said he would bear the medical expenses of 1,000 out of the 2,500 children to be adopted during the campaign.,Talking to the The Hindu on his attempts to make a feature film on AIDS, he said it was difficult to convince filmmakers to work on the project. “I wanted to make the film a decade ago when there was a lot of mockery and resistance. It is time we, along with government, act before the situation turns similar to Africa,” he said. The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS was a major barrier to encourage public participation for the cause. “Rural population, in fact, seems to have a better awareness than urban people as a lot of awareness activities are happening in villages. But yet, people are not ready for a complete acceptance.”,The ‘Petraalthaan Pillai –ya? initiative will embolden more corporates, including insurance companies, and NGOs to come forward to support children with HIV. Expressing confidence that awareness films would do well commercially, Mr.Kamal Haasan said the economically backward, who contribute a lot to the success of a film, are the ones who are patronising films with social messages. “We must understand AIDS and do something about it rather than isolating the victims and shying away from the issue,” Mr.Haasan said.,Deputy Chief Minister M.K.Stalin launched the DVDs and Kiruthiga Udayanidhi Stalin spoke on the making of the film.,Presiding over the event, Mayor M.Subramanian urged theatre owners to come forward to screen the short films and create awareness among people.,Directors Mysskin and Sasi Kumar spoke on growing sensitivity among people to AIDS and contribution of films towards sensitising people.,A book, published by Arumbu Publication, on HIV/AIDS was released on the occasion.

The students should also propagate the message that the infection does not spread through mingling with the infected persons, such as eating along with them or drinking water in the same tumbler in which the infected persons drank water.,Mr. Sekar said that each inmate of the Central Prison, Vellore is subjected to HIV test in the Integrated Testing and Counselling Centre (ICTC) functioning there since April 2008, immediately on his admission to the prison. A special medical team from the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital visited the prison every Thursday and provided treatment to the infected persons.,Raja Sivanandam, Deputy Director of Medical Services (TB) stressed the need for care and support to the AIDS-affected persons since the disease mostly affected the low-income category people. When such people are infected, it leads to their inability to work, leading to their economic backwardness. One should know that AIDS is not a killer disease, but only a lifestyle disease such as blood pressure or diabetes, which are preventable and treatable, but not curable. One’s longevity does not get diminished by the HIV. Death occurs only due to opportunistic infections such as TB. A person not having TB has only 10% chance of getting HIV, whereas a person infected with TB has a 60% chance of getting HIV. AIDS could be tackled only through a multi-pronged approach, with greater commitment on the part of the stakeholders, which includes the members of the community, people living with HIV/AIDS, the medical fraternity, the government and non-governmental organisations, he said.,K.S.T. Suresh, DDHS, Vellore said that ICTCs are functioning in 30 centres in Vellore district, including the government hospitals and primary health centres. In Vellore district, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres are functioning in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital and the Christian Medical College Hospital, while a sub-ART centre is functioning in the Primary Health Centre in Thimiri. About 30,000 child deliveries are taking place in Vellore district every year. Out of the 30,000 mothers who deliver children, 28,000 are tested for the HIV.

,NEW DELHI: People living with HIV/AIDS don’t get life-saving tuberculosis treatment on time and the delay puts their life at risk, according to a recent multi-centre study conducted by the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS with support from Advocacy to Control TB Internationally.,The study indicates significant delays in both detecting and treating TB especially among people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. “Nearly half the 2.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in India contract TB, making it the leading cause of death. Yet less than 5 per cent are automatically tested for TB,” notes the study.,The study also points out that lack of awareness and knowledge about TB ranks high among patients and causes delay in seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Distance from the nearest TB service delivery point is also a key barrier from the provider end, with average travel times exceeding 90 minutes for over 50 p.c. of the population surveyed.,Nearly a third of the surveyed population also reported paying for their medications, indicating an incomplete reach and awareness of the free national TB control programme.,
,
,“People living with HIV/AIDS are among the most vulnerable in getting TB infections. Any delay in this vulnerable population getting life-saving TB treatments is also indicative of broad systemic issues of accessibility that need to be addressed quickly,” said the lead researcher on this study from the Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, Dr. Venkatesan Chakrapani.,“The delay in getting appropriate diagnosis for HIV-infected individuals also reflects on the failure to get newer diagnostic tests on to the market and in our health care delivery points,” he added.,The currently used standard microscopy-based sputum tests fail to detect TB in samples from people living with HIV and having infectious TB, leading to false negative tests and delays in getting a correct diagnosis.,Dr. Bobby John of Global Health Advocates and an adviser on the study said: “There needs to be a further deepening of the service delivery to avoid long travel times for sick people. Distance and poor understanding cause people to drop out of their medications more often than not.”,Ten per cent of the survey participants reported stopping their treatments for a week or more. Incomplete treatment adherence raises the risk of multi-drug resistant TB for the individual and in the community."

,MYSORE: The future of 14 children living with HIV at Snehalaya Makkala Araike Kendra (SMAK) in Mandya hangs in balance as financial assistance extended by the Clinton Foundation of United States under its AIDS prevention programme will end in July 2010.,Sister Beena, coordinator of the kendra, told The Hindu that the Organisation for Development of People (ODP), which had been identified as the nodal centre by the Clinton foundation under its AIDS prevention programme, had been providing financial assistance to the kendra for the past five years.,Assistance was extended through the Karnataka Regional Organisation for Social Service (KROSS). The five-year programme ended in July 2009 and the children living with HIV were left in the lurch. However, based on an appeal from the kendra, the Clinton foundation extended the programme for one more year and provided funds through Citizens Alliance for Rural Development and Training Service (CARDS). This programme would end in July 2010, she said.,Of the 65 children living with HIV in the kendra, 14 aged between 4 and 12, are orphans. The rest have parents and are getting treatment in the kendra under the National Antiretroviral Therapy Programme.,She said the kendra received Rs. 100 for a child from the foundation through ODP to provide food. When the financial aid was stopped in July, the kendra started looking for other donors. “However, obliging to our appeal, the foundation extended the programme by one more year,” she added. There were 75 registered HIV positive children in the district. Though the number of such children was more, it was difficult to identify them in view of the stigma attached to the disease, she said. As the programme would end in six months, the kendra had appealed to donors to make arrangements to support the 14 children. A committee had been formed for the purpose, she said.,Meanwhile, Nagaraj, District AIDS Prevention Programme Nodal Officer, said that free treatment was being provided to the 14 children and it would continue."

However, a patient with HIV+ status would not disclose it to one’s neighbour while the status of one’s diabetes and hypertension is proudly stated.,Ms. George stressed the need for sensitive reporting when dealing with children. Their rights are being infringed upon when the media shows their pictures stating their HIV+ status.

,Thrissur: A workshop on HIV/AIDS anti-stigma campaign organised jointly by the Thrissur Press Club and Rajagiri Outreach on Monday urged the media to play an active role in preventing and eliminating HIV-related stigma. The workshop pointed out that stigma was blocking access to HIV prevention, information, support and treatment services.,
,
,“Stigma and discrimination are among the worst consequences of the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The media should respect confidentiality. Fear of stigma and discrimination compel people living with HIV/AIDS to keep their medical status secret. There should be informed consent of HIV positive persons in regard to news coverage about them. Journalists should use language that is sensitive and politically correct. Avoid terms such as ‘promiscuous’, ‘sufferer’, ‘victim’ and ‘suspected of having HIV’. Sensationalism should be avoided at any cost,” the workshop said.,K. Ajith Kumar, assistant professor with the Thrissur Government Medical College, called upon reporters to follow the Press Council of India guidelines on coverage of HIV/AIDS.,The workshop also examined prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the State. In July 2009, Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy said the State had 10,491 people affected by HIV/AIDS (based on number of cases registered in Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres).,“The HIV epidemic in the State is mainly related to migration. Most of the men have been infected in cities outside Kerala through sex with women sex workers. The infected men in turn infect their spouses. For every two infected men, there is an infected woman. Of late, there has been a change in the pattern of infection. More infections are acquired now from within the State,” the workshop added.,Joy M. Mannur, president, Thrissur Press Club, presided.

Interventions such as combination prevention efforts with young people, early infant diagnosis and Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) for PMTCT are now an integral part of the global HIV response.,In terms of results, the report suggests there has been a substantial increase in access to PMTCT in India. In 2008, in low-and middle-income countries, 45 per cent of HIV positive pregnant women received antiretroviral drugs to prevent PMTCT. That represents an increase from 35 per cent in 2007 — and from just 10 per cent in 2004.,“We need to focus on harmonising actions within maternal, newborn and child-health services and making community-based interventions integral to national scale-up plans,” the report says.,In India, as of September 2009, approximately 6,437 centres provided PPTCT services. Under the PPTCT programme, almost 37 lakh pregnant women were counselled and tested. India reported 10,673 women as receiving ARV prophylaxis in 2008 out of an estimated 49,000 positive pregnant women.,To be effective, paediatric HIV care and treatment need to become an integral part of infant and child survival, and health programmes. Lack of follow-up on mothers and children after birth represents both avoidable child death and a massive loss of investment as children identified as in need and who have been referred to services do not access them, the report says.,The National AIDS Control Organisation in India is planning to roll out the early infant diagnosis by 2010 in 700 integrated counselling and testing centres across the country.,The current economic crisis is likely to worsen poverty in households, which in turn, negatively affects children’s well-being, reducing households’ ability to cope with additional stress. Child-sensitive social protection is a key intervention to reaching affected children. It can help poor households cope and reduce the risk of chronic poverty, which drives children into orphanages, can prevent hazardous child labour and other forms of abuse, as well as supporting greater access to health and education.,In India, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is rolling out an Integrated Child Protection Scheme aimed at creating a system to promote the best interests of a child and prevent violations of his/ her rights."

,Bangalore: In a scenario where 7,400 people contract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) every day in addition to the nearly four million people currently receiving treatment for the infection, the media has to play a pivotal role in influencing public opinion and removing the social stigma faced by people living with HIV/AIDS.,This was the subject of discussion at an editors’ symposium on HIV/AIDS, jointly organised by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS), Avahan — the India AIDS Initiative of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNAIDS, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) and the Centre for Advocacy and Research, here on Monday.,
,
,Making a presentation at the symposium, Health and Family Welfare Commissioner D.N. Nayak said lack of awareness and also social stigma had made matters worse for people living with HIV/AIDS.,“They are afraid and shy to get tested and avail treatment because they are worried of being shunned by society. This disease is now being treated as a social problem rather than a medical problem,” Mr. Nayak said.,
,
,Pointing out that the State Health Department was providing free counselling and treatment for infected persons, the Commissioner elaborated on the number of infected people in Karnataka.,
,
,KSAPS Project Director R.R. Jannu said there has been a sharper decline in HIV prevalence among younger women (under the age of 25). “This is an indication that there is a possible decline in the incidence of HIV in the general population,” he said.,Pointing out that districts in north Karnataka have a higher HIV prevalence among pregnant women, Mr. Jannu said, “However, there is a decline in HIV prevalence in this region to match the prevalence rates in districts of southern Karnataka.,
,
,The sentinel surveillance data also shows that there has been a sharper decline in the HIV prevalence among ante-natal clinic attendees in first referral units (from 1.6 per cent in 2003 to around 0.7 per cent in 2008) compared to those who attend district hospitals (from 1.3 per cent in 2003 to around 1.1 per cent in 2008).,“There are 34 anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres in the State and of these, the State-run Bowring and Lady Curzon Hosptial has been recognised as a centre of excellence by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for HIV/AIDS treatment centre,” Mr. Jannu said.,
,
,UNAIDS India representative Kasinath gave a presentation on the global scenario of the epidemic. “An estimated 33 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and there were 2.7 million new HIV infections and 2 million AIDS-related deaths last year. Globally, women account for half of all HIV infections,” he said.,
,
,“Nearly 4 million people are currently receiving treatment, while 9.7 people are still in need. For every two persons put on treatment, five more get infected. But the social stigma and misconceptions around HIV have forced people to shy away from treatment. That is why sensitive and responsible reporting is crucial,” he said.,

,CHENNAI: The participation of the private healthcare sector in treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) is extremely crucial for the State to progress towards its goal of no new infections, V.K. Subburaj, Principal Secretary, Health, said.,While Tamil Nadu has been touted as a model for the rest of the country in HIV prevention, much of the success has been achieved thanks to fruitful partnerships with a number of international agencies, including CDC Atlanta, UNICEF, USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Population Services International, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and UNDP, among others.,
,
,The partnerships have been so successful that international agencies are happy to come to Tamil Nadu, he said. However, Mr. Subburaj said, in the event that international funding shrinks, it is necessary to have adequate internal private participation to sustain prevention efforts. One of the key areas that public-private partnership is required is in dealing with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as people prefer to go to the private sector for treatment.,At a session on ‘Bridging the 5A Gap in HIV Care: The PPP Way’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mr. Subburaj also signed memoranda of understanding with two private hospitals — Deepam Hospital and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, to partner in the care of HIV infected.,E.K. Krishnamoorthy, convenor, Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, said the gap caused by the 5As — accessibility, affordability, availability, acceptability and accountability — could be addressed with good PPPs. Setting the context for the event, Bimal Charles, project director, AIDS Prevention and Control Project, said the State had come a long way since 1986 when the first cases were detected, but it was true that positive people were still being shunned at hospitals and positive children were being thrown out from schools.,Studies showed that 2.3 per cent of PLHAs complain that doctors and medical staff in the private sector refuse to even touch them in case their positive status is revealed. 89 per cent of positive people employed in the private sector fear that their jobs would be terminated if it got out that they were infected with HIV. “While we have covered the high-risk groups comprehensively, obviously we need to use mass media to approach the entire community with our messages,” he said.,Andrew Simkin, U.S. Consul-General, concurred and added that a lot remains to be done with regard to social attitudes towards HIV. America’s approach to visas has also evolved dramatically, as legislations have enabled people with HIV infection to travel to the U.S., unlike in the past.,S.K. Rajan, Advisor — Panel on Health, CII Tamil Nadu, suggested that all hospitals with 50 beds or more allocate at least five beds for the care of HIV positive people."

,NEW DELHI: Several organisations working on issues surrounding HIV/AIDS on Monday made a vociferous demand for the immediate tabling of the HIV/AIDS Bill, 2009.,The Bill was drafted and finalised in 2006 by the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry after country-wide consultations with stakeholders and sent to the Law Ministry. From 2007 to October 2009, the Law Ministry released four drafts, each omitting several critical provisions aimed at promoting and protecting the rights of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.,
,
,The journey of the HIV/AIDS Bill has been extremely long, characterised by the disappointing drafts, and public protests against various versions of the Bill that diluted its objectives and spirit, Daisy David of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+), told at a press conference here.,It was disheartening to see the Bill shuttling between the two ministries for the past three years. “We need this Bill to fight discrimination against people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS,” she said.,It contains special provisions to address the vulnerabilities of women and children to HIV, according to Manjula K. of Action Aid. “The Bill entitles a survivor of sexual assault, even if it occurs within marriage, to access HIV-related counselling and preventive treatment.”,Pradeep Dutta of the Nai Umang Network of Positive People said passing the law would make it easier for HIV positive people to access treatment. The Bill also provides legal immunity to the provider and the receiver of services under targeted intervention programmes like condom promotion among sex workers and distribution of clean needles to drug users. Now, organisations engaged in risk-reduction programmes faced harassment from the police and other public authorities as these were considered an abetment to sex work and drug use, Mr. Dutta said.,Sudha Jha from Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India (SAATHII), Kolkata, said the targeted intervention programmes proved successful in controlling the spread of the epidemic. “The Bill provides a much needed fillip to these ongoing risk reduction services.”,Joe Thomas of AIDS-INDIA said: “In light of the routine rights violations faced by people living with HIV/AIDS, the tabling and passing of this Bill is extremely important. The government cannot afford to delay this any further.”"

,Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1, people living with HIV, sexuality minorities and transgenders came together on a common platform on Monday to assert that peer tactics and strategies play a key role in HIV prevention.,At an interaction organised on Monday by the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), they alleged that professional counsellors appointed by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) in the Government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and Anti-Retroviral therapy (ART) centres were “indifferent” towards people who visited these centres for tests and treatment.,“They do not understand that we are already facing stigma and discrimination in society. Their approach towards the infected people is crude that discourages us from continuing treatment. We demand that KSAPS appoint peer counsellors in every centre so that we get counselled by people who know our problems,” Thyagaraj, General Secretary of Karnataka Network for People living with HIV, said.,Pointing out that provision of food and nutrition was essential for infected persons, Vijay Kumar from Sadhane, another group of the community, said most of the HIV deaths were owing to lack of nutrition. “Although we are getting free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, they are useless without proper nutrition. We try to mobilise foodgrains and other required items for the needy through our organisation at least for the first three months. But we want the Government to ensure that there is an assured regular supply,” he said.,The other problems faced by HIV positive people included lack of free healthcare facilities."

,‘Rule out first, rather than regret later' is the mantra. However, some people constantly fear they might be suffering from some ailment. Neeraja Murthy reports,This may sound like the story of your life. You spend long hours in front of the computer, have a cushy job and are chilled out with a fast-paced lifestyle.,But, there is one bother — you are fit and fine but feel you might be suffering from some ailment. Your negative laboratory tests do not convince you and you change the doctor in the hope of a satisfactory reply. Welcome to the world of ‘Doubting Thomases' who have wealth and comfort but no peace of mind because of constant fear. “It is basically a psychological disorder. They are called hypochondriacs and the other disorder is Munchausen's Syndrome,” states psychiatrist G. Prasad Rao. The dictionary defines Munchausen's Syndrome ‘as a mental disorder in which a person repeatedly feigns severe illness so as to obtain hospital treatment.',“These people are quite Internet-savvy. They are always seen visiting specialists with a bag filled with reports, ECGs, X-rays, scans and tests. Instead of facing the reality of visiting a psychiatrist for therapy, they suffer and in turn, the family suffers too. They are even nick-named ‘Dr Shoppers',” says the doctor. Awareness campaigns and the importance given to ‘how-to-be-healthy' stories on the small screen and newspapers have made a positive sea change in the mindset.,The mantra is to ‘rule out first rather than regret later'. “This is quite a good trend but these health freaks pick only things they like and try to compare them with their body changes. Like, if they have been visiting the bathroom quite often, they suspect they might be diabetic. Frequent urination is only one of the symptoms of diabetes. Symptoms do not always mean that one has the problem,” says homoeo consultant Dr. Venugopal Gouri.,He says these people have extremes of moods and are paranoid and anxious all the time.,Even as psychiatrists say men and women are equally prone to this disorder, Dr. Venugopal feels women might be more affected as they are more stressed-out than men (due to multi-tasking) and hormonal changes.,Hiral, a counsellor working at KIMS and Lotus Children's Hospital, says these disorders should not be mistaken with lies told by children to bunk school. “Some kids often pretend to have stomach ache to avoid going to school. That could be due to fear of getting the report card or writing some test.”,Hiral also says counsellors face a lot of challenges including non-cooperation by clients. Recalling an incident, she says, “One client had undergone a blood transfusion. He got high fever and was convinced that he had AIDS. I tried to counsel him but he was not happy with my sessions as I did not tell him what he wanted to hear.”,Infertility expert Dr. Roya Rozati has the final word though.,“Just because some people have some disorder, it should not stop others from updating themselves about different health-related issues. If there is no awareness, there is every possibility that they know about an ailment at a last stage. Not just that, some quacks with incomplete knowledge might also take them for a ride.”"

They will attend their first special conference this week to share experiences and call for international recognition of their uniquely difficult circumstances.,A summit of grandparents in the West might prompt jokes about bingo and dentures, but the inaugural African Grandmothers' Gathering, starting in Swaziland on Thursday, is a gravely serious affair.,More than 450 grandmothers from 12 African countries will meet to discuss the impact of losing adult children to AIDS, becoming the head of a household and raising grief-stricken grandchildren as their own.,These forgotten victims hope to build a “solidarity movement” across Africa to make the case that grandmothers need targeted support from international donors.,A lost voice,“It's a lost group, a lost voice,” said Philile Mlotshwa of Swapol (Swaziland Positive Living), which is organising the event in partnership with the Canadian-based Stephen Lewis Foundation . “They are the heroes yet no one has gone to them to say we recognise your efforts.” The organisers say it is time to heed the “indomitable and indefatigable” grandmothers who step forward to care for children, sometimes as many as 10 to 15 in one household. “They are holding together the social fabric of communities across the continent.” Ms Mlotshwa continued: “Grandparents have always played an important role in solving disputes and as a source of knowledge. But now the younger generation is not there: people aged 29 to 49 are dying from HIV-AIDS ... Grandmothers are at the frontline of the HIV-AIDS impact. They have to pick up the pieces and move on. They don't have time to grieve because the children need to be looked after. They are doing this without any income.,In spite of challenges,“They are sick with diabetes and high blood pressure. We are seeing women who are carrying on in spite of the challenges and the fear of what will happen to these grandchildren if they die.” Ms Mlotshwa said she hoped the gathering would raise awareness of grandmothers' needs. “Various responses to HIV-AIDS have been designed but not yet targeted at them.” The grandmothers are likely to seek international support for grief counselling, access to healthcare for themselves and children in their care, safe and adequate housing, economic security, safety from gender-based violence, raising community awareness and breaking stigma, support in raising grief-stricken grandchildren and access to education for children.,Grandmothers from Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe will be represented.,Stephen Lewis, chair of the foundation, said: “Grandmothers [are] the unsung heroes of Africa. These magnificently courageous women bury their own children and then look after their orphaned grandchildren, calling on astonishing reserves of love and emotional resilience.”"

The irony is that this statement is being uttered by responsible persons in high posts.,On Friday during the inauguration ceremony of the sojourn of the Red Ribbon Express in Berhampur, the MLA from Aska, Debaraj Mohanty and Berhampur Mayor Siba Shankar Dash repeated this statement again and again during their speeches. Mr. Mohanty said earlier cancer meant sure death but now HIV infection or AIDS hinted sure death. Similar statement was repeated by the Berhampur Mayor. The HIV persons present in the audience, some of whom were also volunteers of the Red Ribbon Express were too critical of this kind of ‘irresponsible' statements. President of the Rushikulya Network of Positive People , an organisation of HIV positive persons in Ganjam district, Bhaskar Behera, who was there as a volunteer said such remark from a dais aimed at rural representatives from all over the district only adds to the continuing stigma related to HIV positive persons. “Can we say that people who do not have HIV infection would live forever. Then why should it be proclaimed on stage that HIV infection means sure death”, he asked. According to him such statements depress the illiterate HIV positive persons as general public look down at them as somebody who is on death bed.,Baburam Dakua, the coordinator of the Ganjam Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS said such statements are nothing but mockery of greatest uncertainty and ultimate truth of life that is death."

,
,NEW DELHI: Creating a vaccine against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains one of the biggest challenges of modern science.,In the 27 years since HIV was discovered, scientists have learnt a great deal about the virus and how it causes AIDS. Making a vaccine to stop it, however, has proved a greater challenge than anyone could have imagined, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) has said in a statement issued here to mark World AIDS Vaccine Day.,“With 7,400 people newly infected with HIV every day, the best hope we have of ending this human catastrophe is to develop and widely distribute effective vaccines against the virus,” Seth Berkeley, CEO and founder of IAVI, said.,“Last September, a candidate vaccine regimen tested in a large clinical trial in Thailand protected volunteers from HIV with 30 per cent efficacy. That is not as protective as we would like a vaccine to be. Still, the result electrified the field: it was the first demonstration in humans that an AIDS vaccine is possible,” the statement said, adding that the challenge now was to build better vaccines.,“Weeks prior to the release of those results, researchers at and affiliated with the IAVI served up another advance: the discovery of two powerful new antibodies capable of neutralising a wide variety of HIV variants and the identification of the site on the virus to which they attach.,This site provides researchers with a promising new model to design a vaccine against AIDS.,“Subsequently, researchers affiliated with IAVI and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have discovered still more broadly neutralising antibodies to HIV,” the statement said.,‘Importance of testing',“The considerable work that lies ahead will include the continued clinical assessment of candidate AIDS vaccines. That the protective effect seen in the Thai trial was a surprise to most researchers was instructive, underscoring the vital importance of human testing.,“It is thus necessary to build and sustain sufficient human and infrastructure capacity to conduct the required research in such places like sub-Saharan Africa. Part of that effort will be the cultivation of international collaborations that engage the best researchers, companies, clinical research centres and technologies from around the world."

,When the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) launched a major initiative about a year ago to mainstream HIV/AIDS care by seeking the collaboration and involvement of various ministries, government departments, corporate houses and business sector as well as people's representatives, it was not expected to be an overnight success.,The socio-economic aspect of HIV/AIDS cannot be easily conveyed to the people. Also issues such as combating the stigma associated with the disease and workplace issues are topics that require sensitive handling.,However, a year later, the Mainstreaming Division of the KSACS feels that it is on the right track in sensitising the corporate sector and attracting their resources to initiate workplace interventions. According to the KSACS, its pilot project with the Group of Techno Park Companies (G-TECH) has evoked such a positive response that it will now focus its efforts on wooing the corporate sector towards HIV prevention initiatives.,Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS care and getting a multi-sectoral response to HIV prevention and control programmes are the main objectives in the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP).,The core idea behind the mainstreaming effort is that the response to HIV can be effective only if it goes beyond the health sector and connects to people from various sectors.,The health initiatives aside, the idea is to get the government, the corporate sector and the civil society involved in fighting HIV. The KSACS's effort has been to get every department to respond to the challenge of HIV/AIDS by identifying how best they can integrate HIV prevention activities into their core business,The adoption of an HIV/AIDS Policy for its member companies by G-TECH is thus seen as a bold step and proclaims their commitment to inculcate awareness of HIV/AIDS at the deepest level among the member companies, their employees and their families.,The policy states that no employee will be discriminated against and that regular HIV awareness programmes would be taken up at all government-owned information technology parks in the State. The G-TECH companies have incorporated a module on HIV/AIDS in their staff induction training program and are organising voluntary blood donation on a regular basis.,They also are cooperating with the KSACS on various HIV-related initiatives.,The KSACS has been interacting with various government departments, including Social Welfare, Education, Labour, Police, Prison, Tourism and Local Self-Governance, with whom alliances could be forged to spread the message against HIV.,C.

In northeastern States, the percentage of institutional deliveries is about 12 to 20 per cent. The remaining deliveries are at home with no chance of checking if the pregnant women carry the virus or not,” he said.,Noting that testing pregnant mothers on time would save children, he said, “I feel that our programme of testing pregnant women for HIV/AIDS before delivery has to be intensified.,“The number of persons affected by HIV/AIDS in Puducherry may not be as projected. According to information I receive, people from States where HIV is highly prevalent, are visiting Puducherry for treatment. Tourists and people affected by HIV/AIDS coming here makes the Union Territory vulnerable. There is a need to be cautious,” he said.,With awareness being the key to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Mr. Fernandes said, “If we control the virus, the health of the State improves. In some States in Africa, the percentage of population affected by HIV is as high as 30.”,Mr. Fernandes said that the Union and State governments gear up to the need of the hour.,Northeastern States have given top priority to the issue, he added.,“The youth today are vulnerable and awareness has to be created in schools and colleges,” he said.,Chief Minister V.

,VISAKHAPATNAM: When twenty-eight-year-old Lakshmi (name changed) tested positive for the pregnancy test, the happiness of bearing a child after six years of marriage to Srinivas (not real name), an autorickshaw driver, was diminished by the thought of transmitting a deadly virus to the unborn.,Both Lakshmi and Srinivas were carriers of the HIV and they feared that the child would be infected by it. Ignorant of the advancement in the medical sciences in this area, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy, as they were sure that the child will be born with the virus. “Who would take care of an infected child after our death? Even my parents would reject the child. With this thought, we decided on the termination, until we met the outreach workers from PSI (Population Services International),” says Lakshmi.,The PSI representative talked about their ‘YRG-CARE Connect Project' on Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) and made the couple understand that through proper care and treatment of the mother the transmission can be prevented. PSI's Area Programme Manager G.K.V. Ravi Chandra informed that mother-to-child transmission of the virus has been categorised under the high risk groups along with other high risk groups like FSW (female sex workers), IDU (injecting drug users) and MSM (men having sex with men).,“The chances of transmission from an infected mother to a child are tagged under three instances: In the womb, during delivery and by breast feeding. Careful monitoring of the case, timely treatment and administration of Nevirapine to the mother before the labour pains and one dose to the new born immediately after birth can reduce the possibility by a huge margin. A mother is put under ART (antiretroviral) drugs during the pregnancy period if the CD4 count is less than 200,” informed Ravi Chandra.,PSI has tied up with St. Anns Hospital, Malkapuram, for its PPTCT programme and so far has treated 131 infected cases. “Only four out of 131 cases have tested positive. The prevalence rate has significantly dropped from 33 to 3 per cent,” said PSI's VCT/STI Manager K. Srikanth.,Unlike in earlier days when one had to wait for 18 months to assess the status of the virus in a new born, PSI has acquired the DNAPCR kit with support from HPCL. “With this we can detect the virus immediately after birth,” said Srikanth.,Lakshmi and Srinivas are among the fortunate to have a healthy baby and today it is one-year-old. “We know that we are reaching our end, but we are assured that our child is free of the virus and will be taken care of by our parents and family members after our death,” said Lakskmi."

If we conduct blood test to all the prisoners the number may double or triple.,However the blood test is not binding,” said in-charge DIG and Jail Superintendent A.G.

Health screening of every prisoner is a must in accordance with NHRC's direction from many years.,In Rajahmundry prison there are 45 HIV positive cases, in which 25 are lifers, 11 non-lifers, 8 are under-trails. There is no confirmation from officials about how the dreaded disease was spreading in the prison.,From May 2007 to June this year about 20 people died in prison with different ailments including HIV.,Secondly, the number of psychiatric patients is significant. Among the 54 psychiatric patients 32 are lifers, 15 non-lifers and 7 under trails. “We are sending psychiatric patients to Visakhapatnam Psychiatric Hospital for treatment every month and after treatment they are coming back,” said the DIG.,The Rajahmundry Central Jail had violated all norms and directions of NHRC with regard to these patients. NHRC in its direction in the years 1996, 2000 under the chairmanship of Justice Ranganatha Mishra and Justice Varma has clearly instructed jail superintendents through DG's of jails that detention of psychiatric patients amounts to egregious violation of human rights and State governments cannot escape their obligation to provide proper psychiatric treatment to the mentally ill and such people are not to be kept in jail in any circumstance and they should not be treated as unwanted human beings, but put in hospitals."

The credit for this humane act goes to the story telling club members in different parts of the district.,The members of the self help groups have been involved in reducing stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS among the school children and the community through story telling clubs in schools.,The story tellers from the 36 story telling clubs in the schools have already completed the sensitization of 18,500 school children against the stigma through story telling sessions. The impact had already been assessed through interaction of HIV positive persons and the school children. Now it has shifted the focus to the villages, particularly the Self Help Group women promoted by the local NGOs.,The modus operandi is simple but effective. The local NGOs organised meetings of SHGs in which the story tellers from the schools tell stories on stigma/discrimination developed by them based on real life case studies. This sensitization will continue till they agreed to accept the HIV positive people and established social interaction with them.,On a particular date, the SHG women, HIV positive person, preferably women and the story teller used to meet in the village and then started their emotional social interaction. The HIV positive person narrated the agony and pain suffered due to stigma and discrimination as well as the economic hardship suffered by her due to this inhuman social exclusion. Moved by the heart rending history of the affected person, the women share snacks with the affected woman, consoled her and collected money from their savings for her.,So far, the Vasantham Trust has conducted such interaction with more than 75 SHGs. Recently a local NGO, CHARDEP has organised two social interactions in two coastal villages – Enayamputhenthurai and Colachel in which more than 80 women, two HIV positive persons and two story tellers from the schools participated.,C.

,‘Rule out first, rather than regret later' is the mantra. However, some people constantly fear they might be suffering from some ailment. Neeraja Murthy reports,This may sound like the story of your life. You spend long hours in front of the computer, have a cushy job and are chilled out with a fast-paced lifestyle. But, there is one botheration - you are fit and fine but feel you might be suffering from some ailment. Your negative laboratory tests do not convince you and you change the doctor in the hope of a satisfactory reply. Welcome to the world of ‘Doubting Thomases' who have wealth and comfort but no peace of mind because of constant fear. “It is basically a psychological disorder. They are called hypochondriacs and the other disorder is Munchausen's Syndrome,” states psychiatrist G. Prasad Rao. Dictionary defines Munchausen's Syndrome ‘as a mental disorder in which a person repeatedly feigns severe illness so as to obtain hospital treatment.',“These people are quite internet-savvy and have similar characteristics. They are always seen visiting specialists with a bag filled with reports, ECGs, X-rays, scans and tests. Instead of facing the reality of visiting a psychiatrist for therapy, they suffer and in turn the family suffers too. They are even nick-named ‘Dr Shoppers',” says the doctor. Awareness campaigns and the importance given to ‘how-to-be-healthy' stories on the small screen and newspapers have made a positive sea change in the mindset.,The mantra is to ‘rule out first rather than regret later.' “This is quite a good trend but these health freaks pick only things they like and try to compare them with their body changes. Like, if they have been visiting the bathroom quite often, they suspect they might be diabetic. Frequent urination is only one of the symptoms of diabetes. Symptoms do not always mean that one has the problem,” says homoeo consultant Dr. Venugopal Gouri. He says these people have extremes of moods and are paranoid and anxious all the time.,Even as psychiatrists say men and women are equally prone to this disorder, Dr. Venugopal feels women might be more affected as they are more stressed-out than men (due to multi-tasking) and hormonal changes.,Hiral, a counsellor working at KIMS and Lotus Children's Hospital, says these disorders should not be mistaken with lies told by children to bunk school. “Some kids often pretend to have stomach ache to avoid going to school. That could be due to fear of getting the report card or writing some test.”,Hiral also says counsellors face a lot of challenges including non-cooperation by clients. Recalling an incident, she says, “One client had undergone a blood transfusion. He got high fever and was convinced that he had AIDS. I tried to counsel him but he was not happy with my sessions as I did not tell him what he wanted to hear.”,Infertility expert Dr. Roya Rozati has the final word though. “Just because some people have some disorder, it should not stop others from updating themselves about different health-related issues. If there is no awareness, there is every possibility that they know about an ailment at a last stage. Not just that, some quacks with incomplete knowledge might also take them for a ride.”"

He said final touches were being given to the “comprehensive and radical Bill on HIV/AIDS” that has been drafted with an aim to fight discrimination against people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. The Bill was drafted and finalised in 2006 by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare after countrywide consultations with stakeholders, and sent to the Law Ministry. Delay in tabling of the Bill had led to protests by activists.,Speaking about the book, originally written in the Malayalam, Mr. Moily said that more such books that speak openly and boldly against oppression of many kinds should be published in Kannada. People should watch out for the Stockholm Syndrome whereby they get used to oppression, he said. “A silent society is the worst society,” he added. The book, he said, speaks “beyond the written word” and with courage, going beyond the binaries of moral-immoral and right and wrong. Conservative attitudes, he said, were defeating many of good legislations. The book should not be judged by the old hackneyed tools of criticism but with a fresh and open perspective."

,THANJAVUR: As the three short films _ Life, Love and Hope _ dealing with HIV/AIDS- afflicted children ended at Arul Theatre here on Wednesday, a pin drop silence enveloped the audience packed theatre.,Such was the impact of the films that the viewers could not speak for sometime but were engulfed in the feelings the films generated in their mind. The message from the films were loud and clear.,
,
,AIDS-afflicted children should not be treated as untouchables. They should be given love and affection by others.,The films also said that AIDS affected children have more humanism than ordinary people. They can help the society. They can share the love with others. They can live with hope.,
,
,The three films, for which Krithiga Udhayanidhi has written the story, put the message sharp, crisp, straight and in a touching way.,In the first film, an AIDS-afflicted child, who is treated as untouchable by a man, saves the life of the man when he meets with accident. This makes him love the child. As a token of gratitude, he gives a chocolate to her.,The second film shows how the child shares the chocolate with other children by making it melt in sunlight.,The third film showed the longing of two children for the love of their mother who passed away due to AIDS but keeps the hope alive that they could meet her in the Moon, where they believe their mothers had gone.,
,
,The VCDs of the three movies were released by Collector M. S. Shanmugham. Rec.Fr.Amalraj Soosai, Salecian Provincial of Tiruchi, received them.,Ms. Udhayanidhi said that the VCDs would be played in villages to carry on the message.,

Eighty three children , aged six to 22, at the Home set amid a lush green field are studying at schools nearby.,With no government financial support, P.

Anti-retroviral treatment for the inmates was being provided by Government Hospital periodically. The children were being encouraged to play a variety of games including cricket, volley ball and taken for outings.,“Political leaders have already paid frequently visits here but they are yet to pledge their support for development and maintenance.,

It is also a key to the health and well being of their families, communities and societies,” he further pointed out.,But every year, over half a million women in developing countries die in pregnancy and childbirth.,The Safe Motherhood Initiative was started in 1987 to improve maternity services and to protect the health of mothers and their infants.,“HIV presents an enormous challenge to safe motherhood,” he said and added that it was estimated that approximately two million HIV-positive women worldwide would give birth.,In several major towns in eastern and southern Africa, more than a quarter of pregnant women were now HIV positive.,
,
,“Women with HIV are more likely to have complications during pregnancy and delivery, or abortion. They are more vulnerable to anaemia, malaria, pneumonia, urinary infections, and tuberculosis (TB).,“For women with symptomatic HIV, pregnancy can also speed up the progress of their illness to AIDS. In South Africa, about one in eight maternal deaths are directly linked to HIV.”,“It is estimated that in Africa and Asia, more than two million children each year will lose their mother or both parents to AIDS. These children are in high risk group of poverty, neglect and early death.,“HIV can also pass from mother to child during pregnancy, labour and delivery, or through breastfeeding.,“It is not known exactly what proportion of babies born to HIV-positive mothers will be infected themselves, but without any kind of intervention, it is estimated that between 15 and 45 out of every 100 would be infected,” he said.,Around 5,70,000 children aged 14 or younger (most of them in sub-Saharan Africa) became HIV positive in 1999, almost all from mother-to-child transmission.,The prospects for infected children were not good. Children who were HIV positive were over 20 times more likely to die before the age of five than non-infected children.,A study in Rwanda found that even with frequent medical treatment, over a quarter of the children with HIV in the study had died before they were two years old, and over half died before their fifth birthday, he pointed out. ,YRC co-ordinator P. Thirumoorthi presided. The sessions were handled by a team of doctors including Dr. P.Gugapriya, Dr. H.Keerthana and Dr. Selvam.,Funded by UNICEF, it is being implemented for the first time in the country in Salem district.,College students in Salem district, approximately 70,000 will be given awareness in the Phase I programme who in turn make the general public aware under Phase II."

,
,It's been a bad few months for HIV prevention. We've learned that our best candidates for vaccines and virus-killing microbicides don't work. Now we're clutching at another straw: maybe we can treat our way out of the HIV epidemic.,At an HIV research meeting this week, boffins from the World Health Organisation revived a mathematical model that shows that if we test everyone in Africa for HIV once a year and give everyone who tests positive expensive drugs right away and for the rest of their lives, we'll wipe out new HIV infections within seven years. That's because HIV is passed on most easily when there's lots of virus in the infected person's blood and body fluids. Antiretroviral medicines cut the “viral load” (the amount of virus in the body), so they make it more difficult to pass on HIV. Ergo, more treatment means fewer new infections.,Sadly, it's not that simple. For one thing, HIV is most infectious in the few months after a person is first infected. Even if everyone got tested annually, we'd miss most of these new infections. Second, people's viral load spikes upwards if they get another sexually transmitted infection (STI), or if they stop taking their medicine because the clinic runs out of stock, the meds make them feel sick, or they went on a three-day bender and forgot their pills. Interrupting treatment also allows the virus to develop resistance to drugs, and that leads to more spikes in viral load. Most importantly, antiretrovirals keep you alive and well enough to be out there meeting new sex partners. That's a good thing, obviously, but it also means that people who have HIV are going to have more chances to pass it on during those times when their viral load is spiky.,There's more. In countries like the U.K. where treatment has been available for over a decade, AIDS has virtually disappeared. HIV, unfortunately, has not. A few years after antiretrovirals became widely available, new infections among gay men in the U.K. began to rise. We've seen the same thing in Australia, the United States and practically everywhere else we have data. One reason for that is that gay men use condoms less now than they did when HIV = AIDS = a horrible death. Now, though, HIV = a pill every day. Boring, but not the end of the world, unless you're the taxpayer picking up the tab for it or the epidemiologist worrying that drug-resistant strains of HIV will reignite AIDS.,On top of that, many people assume that if the person they're having sex with is infected, they'll be on meds and so not very infectious. Which may be true if they're not in that early peak of infectiousness, have taken all their pills diligently, and don't have another STI. Though since condom use is dropping across the board, other STI rates are soaring. In short, more people living with HIV, combined with more unprotected sex, is outweighing the effects of lower viral load in places where the population is well informed, HIV testing is actively promoted, and treatment has been free and universally available. But in Africa it will be different.,Our computer model assumes every African will get tested for HIV every year, everyone who tests positive will start taking antiretrovirals immediately and 98 out of 100 will never miss a dose. On top of that, though gay men in rich countries use condoms far less now than they did before we had antiretrovirals, we assume that heterosexuals in Africa are going to use them more once the most visible and frightening face of AIDS disappears.,On the strength of this model, which bears as much relation to reality as a British MP's expense claim, we are going to hail expanded HIV treatment in Africa as the new answer to prevention. A triumph of optimism over common sense. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010,( Elizabeth Pisani is a consultant epidemiologist specialising in HIV prevention.
